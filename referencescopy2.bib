	note = {While deep networks have been enormously successful over the last decade, they rely on flat-feature vector representations, which makes them unsuitable for richly structured domains such as those arising in applications like social network analysis. Such domains rely on relational representations to capture complex relationships between entities and their attributes. Thus, we consider the problem of learning neural networks for relational data. We distinguish ourselves from current approaches that rely on expert hand-coded rules by learning relational random-walk-based features to capture local structural interactions and the resulting network architecture. We further exploit parameter tying of the network weights of the resulting relational neural network, where instances of the same type share parameters. Our experimental results across several standard relational data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over multiple neural net baselines as well as state-of-the-art statistical relational models.},

	note = {Recently, Lifted Marginal Filtering has been proposed, an efficient Bayesian filtering algorithm for stochastic systems consisting of multiple, (inter-)acting agents and objects (entities). The algorithm achieves its efficiency by performing inference jointly over groups of sim- ilar entities (i.e. their properties follow the same distribution). In this paper, we explore the case where there are no entities that are directly suitable for grouping. We propose to use methods from Gaussian mixture fitting to identify entity groups, such that the error imposed by grouping them (by approximating their properties by a distribution) is minimal. Furthermore, we show how Gaussian mixture merging methods can be used to prevent the number of groups from growing indefinitely over time. We evaluate our approach on an activity prediction task in an online multiplayer game. The results suggest that compared to the conventional approach, where all entities are handled individually, de- crease in prediction accuracy is small, while inference runtime decreases significantly.},

In plant breeding, phenotyping of genotypes is realized by time consuming and expensive visual plant ratings. During resistance reactions and during pathogenesis plants initiate different structural and biochemical defence mechanisms, which partly affect the optical properties of plant organs. Recently, intensive research has been conducted to develop innovative optical methods for an assessment of compatible and incompatible plant pathogen interaction. These approaches, combining classical phytopathology or microbiology with technology driven methods - such as sensors, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence --- are summarized by the term digital phenotyping. In contrast to common visual rating, detection and assessment methods, optical sensors in combination with advanced data analysis methods are able to retrieve pathogen induced changes in the physiology of susceptible or resistant plants non-invasively and objectively. Within this review, recent advances of digital phenotyping technologies for the detection of subtle resistance reactions and resistance breeding are highlighted and methodological requirements are critically discussed.},

The ultraviolet range (UV, 200-380 nm) has not yet been used in plant phenotyping even though a number of plant molecules like flavones and phenol feature absorption maxima in this range. In this study an imaging UV line scanner in the range of 250 - 430 nm is introduced to investigate crop plants for plant phenotyping. Observing plants in the UV-range can provide information about important changes of plant substances. To record reliable and reproducible time series results, measurement conditions were defined that exclude phototoxic effects of UV-illumination in the plant tissue. The measurement quality of the UV-camera has been assessed by comparing it to a non-imaging UV-spectrometer by measuring six different white-colored plant-based substances. Given the findings of these preliminary studies, an experiment has been defined and performed monitoring the stress response of barley leaves to salt stress. The aim was to visualize the effects of abiotic stress within the UV-range to provide new insights into the stress response of plants visualizing the effects of abiotic stress within the UV-range to provide new insights into the stress response of plants at the example of the stress response of barley leaves to salt stress.

We propose the use of probabilistic context-free grammars to sequence a series of primitives to generate complex robot policies from a given library of primitives. The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However, the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the posteriors of the grammars given the observations. Restrictions over operators connecting the search define the corresponding proposal distributions and, therefore, guide the optimization additionally. In experiments, we validate our method on a redundant 7 degree-of-freedom lightweight robotic arm on tasks that require the generation of complex sequences of motions out of simple primitives.},

Most previous work on learning AC structures, however, hinges on inducing a tree-structured AC and, hence, may potentially break loops that may exist in the true generative model. To repair such broken loops, we propose a gradient-boosted method for structure learning of discriminative ACs (DACs), called DACBOOST. Since, in discrete domains, ACs are essentially equivalent to mixtures of trees, DACBOOST decomposes a large AC into smaller tree-structured ACs and learns them in a sequential, additive manner. The resulting non-parametric manner of learning the DACs results in a model with very few tuning parameters making our learned model significantly more efficient. We demonstrate on standard data sets and some real-world data sets, the efficiency of DACBOOST compared to the state-of-the-art DAC learners without sacrificing the effectiveness. This makes it possible to employ DACs for large scale real-world tasks.},

In the past years, the database community has been working on different techniques for Approximate Query Processing (AQP) that aim to deliver an approximate query result given a fixed time bound to support interactive visualizations better. However, classical AQP approaches suffer from various problems that limit the applicability to support the ad-hoc exploration of a new data set: (1) Classical AQP approaches that perform online sampling can support ad-hoc exploration queries but yield low quality if executed over rare subpopulations. (2) Classical AQP approaches that rely on offline sampling can use some form of biased sampling to mitigate these problems but require a priori knowledge of the workload, which is often not realistic if users want to explore a new database. In this paper, we present a new approach to AQP called Model-based AQP that leverages generative models learned over the complete database to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds. Different from classical AQP approaches, generative models allow us to compute responses to ad-hoc queries and deliver high-quality estimates also over rare subpopulations at the same time. In our experiments with real and synthetic data sets, we show that Model-based AQP can in many scenarios return more accurate results in a shorter runtime. Furthermore, we think that our techniques of using generative models presented in this paper can not only be used for AQP in databases but also has applications for other database problems including Query Optimization as well as Data Cleaning.},

Classical approaches for density estimation are usually not flexible enough to deal with the uncertainty inherent to real-world data: they are often restricted to fixed latent interaction models and homogeneous likelihoods; they are sensitive to missing, corrupt and anomalous data; and their expressiveness generally comes at the price of intractable inference. As a result, supervision from statisticians is usually needed to find the right model for the data. However, as domain experts do not necessarily have to be experts in statistics, we propose Automatic Bayesian Density Analysis (ABDA) to make density estimation accessible at large. ABDA automates the selection of adequate likelihood models from arbitrarily rich dictionaries while modeling their interactions via a deep latent structure adaptively learned from data as a sum-product network. ABDA casts uncertainty estimation at these local and global levels into a joint Bayesian inference problem, providing robust and yet tractable inference. Extensive empirical evidence shows that ABDA is a suitable tool for automatic exploratory analysis of heterogeneous tabular data, allowing for missing value estimation, statistical data type and likelihood discovery, anomaly detection and dependency structure mining, on top of providing accurate density estimation.},

They complement each other, and the1 next breakthrough lies not only in pushing each of them but also in combining them.},

	note = {Probabilistic models provide a framework for describing abstract prior knowledge and using it to reason under uncertainty. Deep probabilistic programming languages (PPL) are a powerful tool to ease the development of probabilistic models. They let users specify generative probabilistic models as programs and then ``compile'' those models down into inference procedures. Since probabilistic inference is still intractable, existing deep PPLs leverage deep learning for inference. The key idea is to describe inference via a second model called an inference model trained in variational fashion. Both the generative and the inference models can include deep neural networks as components. While the details of the employed neural architectures may differ, they typically model distributions only implicitly, i.e., they allow for sampling but not the computation of marginal probabilities. This extended abstract makes the case to not "go down the full neural road", but to explicitly obtain uncertainties in an arithmetic circuit manner. To this end, sum-product networks (SPNs) are a promising option, as they are a class of probabilistic model which permit explicit uncertainties and efficient inference. More precisely, SPNs can compute any marginalization and conditioning query in time linear of the model's representation size. Although SPNs can be described in a nutshell as "deep mixture models", they have received no attention in the deep PPL community, despite their attractive inference properties.},

To overcome this, we propose to extend density estimation to Automatic Bayesian Density Analysis (ABDA), casting both data modeling and selection of adequate likelihood models (statistical data types) into a joint inference problem. Specifically, we advocate a hierarchically structured mixture model, which explicitly incorporates arbitrarily rich collections of likelihood models and corresponding latent selection variables, and captures variable interactions by a latent hierarchical structure obtained from data-type agnostic structure learning. To account for prediction uncertainty, selection of parametric likelihood models and statistical data types, we employ Bayesian inference over a model formulated as a sum-product network, naturally providing the aforementioned expressiveness and flexibility, while facilitating exact and tractable inference.},

The education of such specialists is supposed to combine elements from the three fields of engineering, data analysis and data administration. Data administration skills are demanded to handle big data in diverse storage structures in data bases. In order to extract knowledge from the stored data the proficient handling of data analysis tools - especially machine learning - is essential. Finally, industrial domain knowledge is important to identify possible applications for machine learning algorithms (and to interpret the results). However, to the best knowledge of the authors, an education program incorporating elements of all three fields has not yet been established (in Germany). In the context of the newly acquired project "Industrial Data Science" (InDaS) we aim to develop a qualification concept for machine learning in industrial production targeted at two different groups. On the one hand advanced students from any of the three fields mentioned above and on the other hand experienced professionals working in industrial production. For the first group a one term lecture is going to be designed while coping with different levels of knowledge in the inhomogeneous audience. It will be followed by a seminar with focus on use cases delivered by partners from industrial production. Separately a workshop concept for the second target group will be developed taking into account the strong domain knowledge of the participants. The contents of the qualification concept should be selected according to the needs of industrial companies. Therefore a survey was created to inquire the use and potentials of machine learning and the requirements for future employees in industrial production. The evaluation of the survey and the resulting conclusions affecting the qualification concept are going to be presented in this talk.},

	note = {In recent years, weighted model counting (WMC) has become the de facto work-horse for logically-structured inference tasks. Problems ranging over probabilistic inference, planning, game theory, and numerical optimization have been tackled successfully using WMC technology. Weighted model integration (WMI) is a recent formalism generalizing WMC to the integration of functions over models of mixed discrete-continuous theories. WMI has already shown tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic programs. Yet, state of the art tools for WMI are nowhere as versatile as those for WMC--solvers are generally limited either by the range of amenable theories, or in terms of performance. Moreover, the data structures to represent, compose, and transform formulas over mixed theories have not reached the efficiency of their Boolean counterparts. Arguably, the latter is one of the prime reasons why WMC is so widely applicable. To address both limitations, we propose the use of extended algebraic decision diagrams (XADDs) as a compilation language for WMI. Aside from tackling typical WMI problems XADDs also enable partial WMI yielding parametrized solutions. To overcome the main roadblock of XADDs---the computational cost of variable elimination---we formulate a novel and powerful exact symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm that unlike its predecessor is able to effectively cache partial computations and seamlessly handle Boolean, integer-valued, and real variables. Our empirical results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can lead to an exponential to linear computational reduction in the best case and that it exceeds or matches state-of-the-art WMI solvers in terms of performance.},

The probabilistic logic framework is task-dependent. It semantically reasons about pre-grasp configurations with respect to the intended task and employs object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent grasping points. The logic-based module receives data from a low-level module that extracts semantic objects parts, and sends information to the low-level grasp planner. These three modules define our probabilistic logic framework, which is able to perform robotic grasping in realistic kitchen-related scenarios.},

	note = {Movement Primitives are a well studied and widely applied concept in modern robotics. Composing primitives out of an existing library, however, has shown to be a challenging problem. We propose the use of probabilistic context-free grammars to sequence a series of primitives to generate complex robot policies from a given library of primitives. The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However, the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict and efficiently search the grammar space.

Restrictions over operators connecting the search define the corresponding proposal distributions and, therefore, guide the optimization additionally.

Users spend significant amounts of time in identifying the parametric form of the random variables (Gaussian, Poisson, Logit, etc.) involved and learning the mixed models. To make this difficult task easier, we propose the first trainable probabilistic deep architecture for hybrid domains that features tractable queries. It is based on Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) with piecewise polynomial leave distributions together with novel nonparametric decomposition and conditioning steps using the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R{\'e}nyi Maximum Correlation Coefficient. This relieves the user from deciding a-priori the parametric form of the random variables but is still expressive enough to effectively approximate any continuous distribution and permits efficient learning and inference. Our empirical evidence shows that the architecture, called Mixed SPNs, can indeed capture complex distributions across a wide range of hybrid domains.},

In this paper, we show how to construct coresets --- compressed data sets which can be used as proxy for the original data and have provably bounded worst case error --- for Gaussian dependency networks (DNs), i.e., cyclic directed graphical models over Gaussians, where the parents of each variable are its Markov blanket. Specifically, we prove that Gaussian DNs admit coresets of size independent of the size of the data set. Unfortunately, this does not extend to DNs over members of the exponential family in general. As we will prove, Poisson DNs do not admit small coresets. Despite this worst-case result, we will provide an argument why our coreset construction for DNs can still work well in practice on count data. To corroborate our theoretical results, we empirically evaluated the resulting Core DNs on real data sets. The results demonstrate significant gains over no or naive sub-sampling, even in the case of count data.},

Monitoring the healing response of injured tissue is of high importance for basic research and clinical practice. In traditional application, biological markers characterize normal and abnormal wound healing. Understanding functional relationships of these biological processes is essential for developing new treatment strategies. However, most of the present techniques (in vitro or in vivo) include invasive microscopic or analytical tissue sampling. In the present study, a non-invasive alternative for monitoring processes during wound healing is introduced. Within this context, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging and innovative non-invasive imaging technique with different opportunities in medical applications. HSI acquires the spectral reflectance of an object, depending on its biochemical and structural characteristics. For analysing the complex hyperspectral data, an efficient unsupervised approach for clustering massive hyperspectral data was designed, based on efficient hierarchical decomposition of spectral information according to archetypal data points. It represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an advanced Data Mining approach in context of non-invasive analysis of wounds using hyperspectral imagery.},

Unfortunately, the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm scales exponentially in k. Consequently, we devise a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation guarantees using conditional Rademacher averages. On bounded degree graphs, it can even be computed in constant time. We support our theoretical results with experiments on several graph classification benchmarks, showing that our kernels often outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracies.},

Optical sensors are advanced techniques for phenotyping host-pathogen interactions on different scales and for detecting subtle plant resistance responses against pathogens. A microscope with a hyperspectral camera was used to study interactions between Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei and barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes with high susceptibility or resistance due to hypersensitive response (HR) and papilla formation. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of pathogen development was used to explain changes in hyperspectral signatures. Within 48 hours after inoculation, genotype specific changes in the green and red range (500-690 nm) and a blue shift of the red edge inflection point were observed. Manual analysis indicated resistance-specific reflectance patterns from one to three days after inoculation. These changes could be linked to host plant modifications depending on individual host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Retrospective analysis of hyperspectral images revealed spectral characteristics of HR against B. graminis f. sp. hordei. For early HR detection, an advanced data mining approach localized HR spots before they became visible on the RGB images derived from hyperspectral imaging. The link among processes during pathogenesis and host resistance to changes in hyperspectral signatures, provide evidence that sensor based phenotyping is suitable to advance time-consuming and cost-expensive visual rating of plant disease resistances.},

The output of this step comprises a huge number of rules (given fairly low confidence and support parameters) and these cannot directly be used for the purpose of classification as they are usually inconsistent with one another. Therefore, in the second step, we interpret these rules as the input for approaches to structured argumentation. Using the argumentative inference procedures of these approaches and given a new observation, the classification of the new observation is determined by constructing arguments on top of these rules for the different classes and determining their justification status.},

	note = {Numerical optimization is arguably the most prominent computational framework in machine learning and AI. It can be seen as an assembly language for hard combinatorial problems ranging from classification and regression in learning, to computing optimal policies and equilibria in decision theory, to entropy minimization in information sciences. Unfortunately, specifying such problems in complex domains involving relations, objects and other logical dependencies is cumbersome at best, requiring considerable expert knowledge, and solvers require models to be painstakingly reduced to standard forms. To overcome this, we introduce a rich modeling framework for optimization problems that allows convenient codification of symbolic structure. Rather than reducing this symbolic structure to a sparse or dense matrix, we represent and exploit it directly using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Combining efficient ADD-based matrix-vector algebra with a matrix-free interior-point method, we develop an engine that can fully leverage the structure of symbolic representations to solve convex linear and quadratic optimization problems. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.},

This raises the question, whether this holds for optimization problems in general. Here we show that for a large class of optimization methods this is actually the case. Specifically, we introduce the concept of fractional symmetries of convex quadratic programs (QPs), which lie at the heart of many AI and machine learning approaches, and exploit it to lift, i.e., to compress QPs. These lifted QPs can then be tackled with the usual optimization toolbox (off-the-shelf solvers, cutting plane algorithms, stochastic gradients etc.). If the original QP exhibits symmetry, then the lifted one will generally be more compact, and hence more efficient to solve.},

	note = {One of the challenges to information extraction is the requirement of human annotated examples, commonly called gold-standard examples. Many successful approaches alleviate this problem by employing some form of distant supervision, i.e., look into knowledge bases such as Freebase as a source of supervision to create more examples. While this is perfectly reasonable, most distant supervision methods rely on a hand-coded background knowledge that explicitly looks for patterns in text. For example, they assume all sentences containing Person X and Person Y are positive examples of the relation married(X, Y). In this work, we take a different approach -- we infer weakly supervised examples for relations from models learned by using knowledge outside the natural language task. We argue that this method creates more robust examples that are particularly useful when learning the entire information-extraction model (the structure and parameters). We demonstrate on three domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to using distant supervision labels or a smaller set of gold-standard labels.},

	note = {We propose relational linear programming, a simple framework for combing linear programs (LPs) and logic programs. A relational linear program (RLP) is a declarative LP template defining the objective and the constraints through the logical concepts of objects, relations, and quantified variables. This allows one to express the LP objective and constraints relationally for a varying number of individuals and relations among them without enumerating them. Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logical program consisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP. This ground LP is solved using lifted linear programming. That is, symmetries within the ground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the reduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. In contrast to mainstream LP template languages like AMPL, which features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a more intuitive representation of optimization problems over relational domains. We illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in Markov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision processes, and on collective inference using LP support vector machines.},

Propagation kernels are based on monitoring how information spreads through a set of given graphs. They leverage early-stage distributions from propagation schemes such as random walks to capture structural information encoded in node labels, attributes, and edge information. This has two benefits. First, off-the-shelf propagation schemes can be used to naturally construct kernels for many graph types, including labeled, partially labeled, unlabeled, directed, and attributed graphs. Second, by leveraging existing efficient and informative propagation schemes, propagation kernels can be considerably faster than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing predictive performance. We will also show that if the graphs at hand have a regular structure, for instance when modeling image or video data, one can exploit this regularity to scale the kernel computation to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes. We support our contributions by exhaustive experiments on a number of real-world graphs from a variety of application domains.},

Specifically, we introduce a new probabilistic logic module to first semantically reason about pre-grasp configurations with respect to the intended tasks. Further, a mapping is learned from part-related visual features to good grasping points. The probabilistic logic module makes use of object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent grasping points.

Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed GPC method using privileged noise, called GPC+, improves over a standard GPC without privileged knowledge, and also over the current state-of-the-art SVM-based method, SVM+.

Instead, we introduce GeoDBLP where we propagate geographical seed locations retrieved from the web across the DBLP database of 1,080,958 authors and 1,894,758 papers. But perhaps more important is that we are able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the migration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not memoryless but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to make k>1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that migration at later career stages is memoryless. This aligns well but actually goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education and research worldwide.},

In this paper, we examine the merits of such claims and analyze how collective attention into Internet memes evolves over time. We introduce and discuss statistical models of the dynamics of fads and fit them to meme related time series obtained from Google Trends. Given data as to more than 200 memes, we find that our models provide more accurate descriptions of the dynamics of growth and decline of collective attention to individual Internet memes than previous approaches from the literature. In short, our results suggest that Internet memes are nothing but fads.},

Today's datasets from longitudinal studies offer great promise to uncover these interactions but also pose enormous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with potential long-range interactions over time. Our investigation demonstrates that a statistical relational analysis of longitudinal data can easily uncover complex interactions of risks factors and actually predict future coronary artery calcification (CAC) levels --- an indicator of the risk of CHD present subclinically in an individual --- significantly better than traditional non-relational approaches. The uncovered long-range interactions between risk factors conform to existing clinical knowledgeand are successful in identifying risk factors at the early adult stage.

Powerful and disease-specific analysis methods have to be developed for a successful evaluation of diseased plants by hyperspectral sensors. Based on the model system barley and the foliar diseases net blotch (caused by Pyrenophora teres), leaf rust (due to Puccinia hordei) and powdery mildew (due to Blumeria graminis hordei) full range spectral signatures of infected leaves were recorded using hyperspectral VIS/NIR and SWIR cameras. Spectral data cubes were analysed by extracting specific spectral signatures of disease symptoms during pathogenesis. Spectral patterns were observed with high resolution in time and space. Advanced data mining methods were used for the differentiation and quantification of diseased leaf tissue. An effective and automatic image analysis approach has been established by now. In a next step the models will be extended to other crops and their diseases.},

The plant reactions to drought stress result in spatial, temporal and tissue-specific pattern changes which can be detected using non-invasive sensor techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging. The ``response turning time-point'' in the temporal curve of plant response to stress rather than the maxima is the most relevant time-point for guided sampling to get insights into mechanistic basis of plant response to drought stress. Comparative hyperspectral image analysis was performed on barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants grown under well-watered and water stress conditions in two consecutive years. The obtained massive, high-dimensional data cubes were analysed with a recent matrix factorization technique based on simplex volume maximization of hyperspectral data and compared to several drought-related traits. The results show that it was possible to detect and visualize the accelerated senescence signature in stressed plants earlier than symptoms become visible by the naked eye.},

Typical ways to address this scaling issue are inference by approximate message passing, stochastic gradients, and MapReduce, among others.

It has been shown that inference and training can indeed benefit from exploiting symmetries, for example by lifting loopy belief propagation (LBP).That is, a model is compressed by grouping nodes together that send and receive identical messages so that a modified LBP running on the lifted graph yields the same marginals as LBP on the original one, but often in a fraction of time.

In this work, we take a different approach -- we create weakly supervised examples for relations by using commonsense knowledge. The key innovation is that this commonsense knowledge is completely independent of the natural language text. This helps when learning the full model for information extraction as against simply learning the parameters of a known CRF or MLN.

Indeed, different abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel method for selecting logical hidden Markov models from data called SAGEM. SAGEM combines generalized expectation maximization, which optimizes parameters, with structure search for model selection using inductive logic programming refinement operators.

Pre-symptomatic water stress detection is of particular interest, ultimately helping to meet the challenge of ``How to feed a hungry world?''. Due to the climate change, this is of considerable political and public interest. Due to its large-scale and temporal nature, e.g., when monitoring plants using hyper-spectral imaging, and the demand of physical meaning of the results, it presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability. However, big data matrices over time also arise in several other real-life applications such as stock market monitoring where a business sector is characterized by the ups and downs of each of its companies per year or topic monitoring of document collections. Therefore, we consider the general problem of embedding data matrices into Euclidean space over time without making any assumption on the generating distribution of each matrix. To do so, we represent all data samples by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time. On the simplex spanned by the extremes, there are then natural candidates for distributions inducing distances between and in turn embeddings of the data matrices. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic, text, and financial data as well as a large-scale dataset on water stress detection in plants with more than 3 billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that the embeddings are meaningful and fast to compute. The stress detection results were validated by a domain expert and conform to existing plant physiological knowledge.

	note = {Low-rank approximations which are computed from selected rows and columns of a given data matrix have attracted considerable attention lately. They have been proposed as an alternative to the SVD because they naturally lead to interpretable decompositions which was shown to be successful in application such as fraud detection, fMRI segmentation, and collaborative filtering. The CUR decomposition of large matrices, for example, samples rows and columns according to a probability distribution that depends on the Euclidean norm of rows or columns or on other measures of statistical leverage. At the same time, there are various deterministic approaches that do not resort to sampling and were found to often yield factorization of superior quality with respect to reconstruction accuracy. However, these are hardly applicable to large matrices as they typically suffer from high computational costs. Consequently, many practitioners in the field of data mining have abandon deterministic approaches in favor of randomized ones when dealing with today's large-scale data sets. In this paper, we empirically disprove this prejudice. We do so by introducing a novel, linear-time, deterministic CUR approach that adopts the recently introduced Simplex Volume Maximization approach for column selection. The latter has already been proven to be successful for NMF-like decompositions of matrices of billions of entries. Our exhaustive empirical study on more than 30 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrates that it is also beneficial for CUR-like decompositions. Compared to other deterministic CUR-like methods, it provides comparable reconstruction quality but operates much faster so that it easily scales to matrices of billions of elements. Compared to sampling-based methods, it provides competitive reconstruction quality while staying in the same run-time complexity class.},

We evaluated DAR on two hyperspectral image series of plants over time with about 2 (resp. 5.8) Billion matrix entries.

In order to effciently extract graph features from continuous node label distributions, and in general from continuous vector-valued node attributes, we utilize randomized techniques, which easily allow for deriving similarity measures based on propagated information. We show that propagation kernels utilizing locality-sensitive hashing reduce the runtime of existing graph kernels by several orders of magnitude.

When applied to game telemetry data, pattern recognition and statistical analysis provide valuable business intelligence tools for game development. An important problem in this area is to characterize how player engagement in a game evolves over time. Reliable models are of pivotal interest since they allow for assessing the long-term success of game products and can provide estimates of how long players may be expected to keep actively playing a game. In this paper, we introduce methods from random process theory into game data mining in order to draw inferences about player engagement. Given large samples (over 250,000 players) of behavioral telemetry data from five different action-adventure and shooter games, we extract information as to how long individual players have played these games and apply techniques from lifetime analysis to identify common patterns. In all five cases, we find that the Weibull distribution gives a good account of the statistics of total playing times. This implies that an average player's interest in playing one of the games considered evolves according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Therefore, given data on the initial playtime behavior of the players of a game, it becomes possible to predict when they stop playing.},

An appealing idea for such situations is to train and recombine local models. This breaks long-range dependencies and allows to exploit lifting within and across the local training tasks. Moreover, it naturally paves the way for online training for relational models. Specifically, we develop the first lifted stochastic gradient optimization method with gain vector adaptation, which processes each lifted piece one after the other.

Our key insight is that while there may be an infinite number of observations, there are only a finite number of continuous observation partitionings that are relevant for optimal decision-making when a finite, fixed set of reachable belief states is considered. To this end, we make two important contributions: (1) we show how previous exact symbolic dynamic programming solutions for continuous state MDPs can be generalized to continuous state POMDPs with discrete observations, and (2) we show how recently developed symbolic integration methods allow this solution to be extended to PBVI for continuous state and observation POMDPs with potentially correlated, multivariate continuous observation spaces.},

In this paper, we show that a linear-time transformation efficiently copes with sum-to-unity constraints: first, we select a small number K of diverse data points by maximizing the volume of the simplex spanned by these prototypes; second, we represent each data point by means of its cosine similarities to the K selected prototypes. This maximum volume hashing is sensible since each dimension in the transformed space is likely to follow a von Mises (vM) distribution, and, in very high dimensions, the vM distribution closely resembles a Gaussian distribution. This justifies to employ PCA on the transformed data. Our extensive experiments validate this: maximum volume hashing outperforms spectral hashing and other state of the art techniques.},

This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

In doing so, one can easily induce highly complex features over several iterations and in turn estimate quickly a very expressive model.

Classical supervised learning algorithms often fail in applied plant sciences due to their need of labelled datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Therefore, new approaches for unsupervised learning of relevant patterns are needed. We apply for the first time a recent matrix factorisation technique, simplex volume maximisation (SiVM), to hyperspectral data. It is an unsupervised classification approach, optimised for fast computation of massive datasets. It allows calculation of how similar each spectrum is to observed typical spectra. This provides the means to express how likely it is that one plant is suffering from stress. The method was tested for drought stress, applied to potted barley plants in a controlled rain-out shelter experiment and to agricultural corn plots subjected to a two factorial field setup altering water and nutrient availability. Both experiments were conducted on the canopy level. SiVM was significantly better than using a combination of established vegetation indices. In the corn plots, SiVM clearly separated the different treatments, even though the effects on leaf and canopy traits were subtle.},

We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E3 and R-MAX algorithms. Efficient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efficiency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efficient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.},

Recently, efficient algorithms were presented for updating the structure of an existing lifted network with incremental changes to the evidence. In the inference stage, however, current algorithms need to construct a separate lifted network for each evidence case and run a modified message passing algorithm on each lifted network separately. Consequently, symmetries across the inference tasks are not exploited. In this paper, we present a novel lifted message passing technique that exploits symmetries across multiple evidence cases. The benefits of this multi-evidence lifted inference are shown for several important AI tasks such as computing personalized PageRanks and Kalman filters via multievidence lifted Gaussian belief propagation.},

Although, a very first link between both fields has been established already in the early 90ies, many recent papers on mobility mining seem to be unaware of it. We therefore revisit the link and show that many unexplored and novel mobility mining methods fall naturally out of it. Specifically, using advanced discretization techniques for stay-point detection and map matching, we turn traffic sequences into a biological ones. Then, we introduce a novel distance function that enables us to directly apply the rich toolbox for biological sequence analysis to it. For instance, by just looking at co mplex traffic data through the biological glasses of sequence logos we get a novel, easy-to-grasp visualization of data, called Traffic Logos. For clustering and prediction tasks, our empirical evaluation on three real-world data sets demonstrates that revisiting the link can yield performance as good as state-of-the-art data mining techniques.},

Then, we find paths of atoms that are connected via their arguments, variablize the ground atoms in each path, in order to create features for the query. These features are used to re-personalize the original RWR and to finally compute the set completion, based on Label Propagation. Moreover, we exploit that RWR techniques can naturally be lifted and show that lifted inference for label propagation is possible.

A popular solution in these cases is the idea of turning the complex inference task into a sequence of simpler ones by selecting and clamping variables one at a time and running lifted message passing again after each selection. This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference.

For propositional worlds, functional gradient methods have been proved to be beneficial. They are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient, more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the form of the function. Building on recent generalizations of functional gradient boosting to relational representations, we implement a functional gradient boosting approach to imitation learning in relational domains. In particular, given a set of traces from the human teacher, our system learns a policy in the form of a set of relational regression trees that additively approximate the functional gradients. The use of multiple additive trees combined with relational representation allows for learning more expressive policies than what has been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in several different domains.},

This type of information can be valuable not only for finding and tracking scientists using map interfaces but also for automatic detection of con- flict of interests and, in aggregate form, for helping to understand topics and trends in science at global scale. In this work-in-progress report, we consider the problem of retrieving affiliations from few observed affiliations only. Specifically, we crawl ACM's Digital Libraries for affiliations of authors listed in DBLP. Then, we employ multi-label propagation to propagate the few observed affiliations through out a network induced by a Markov logic network on DBLP entries. We use the propagated affiliations to create a visualization tool, PubMap, that can help expose the affiliations, using a map interface to display the propagated affiliations. Furthermore, we motivate how the information about affiliations can be used in publication summarization.},

In the inference stage, however, current algorithms need to construct a separate lifted network for each evidence case and run a modified message passing algorithm on each lifted network separately. Consequently, symmetries across the inference tasks are not exploited. In this paper, we present a novel lifted message passing technique that exploits symmetries across multiple evidence cases.

	note = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

First order decision diagrams (FODD) are a compact knowledge representation expressing functions over relational structures. They represent numerical functions that, when constrained to the Boolean range, use only existential quantification. Previous work has developed a set of operations for composition and for removing redundancies in FODDs, thus keeping them compact, and showed how to successfully employ FODDs for solving large-scale stochastic planning problems through the formalism of relational Markov decision processes (RMDP). In this paper, we introduce several new ideas enhancing the applicability of FODDs. More specifically, we first introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and composition operations for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we develop a novel approach for reducing (G)FODDs using model checking. This yields -- for the first time -- a reduction that maximally reduces the diagram for the FODD case and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs. Finally we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a complete solution for the case where the reward function is specified using an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers.},

In this work, we show that it is also possible to exploit the full expressive power of first-order quantification to achieve state, action, and observation abstraction in a dynamic programming solution to relationally specified POMDPs. Among the advantages of this approach are the ability to maintain compact value function representations, abstract over the space of potentially optimal actions, and automatically derive compact conditional policy trees that minimally partition relational observation spaces according to distinctions that have an impact on policy values. This is the first lifted relational POMDP solution that can optimally accommodate actions with a potentially infinite relational space of observation outcomes.},

We demonstrate this idea by introducing novel model-checking reduction operations for First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a representation that has been used to implement decision-theoretic planning with Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP). Intuitively, these reductions modify the construction of the value function by removing any complex specifications that are irrelevant to the set of training examples, thereby focusing on the region of interest. We show that such training examples can be constructed on the fly from a description of the planning problem thus we can bootstrap to get a self-taught planning system. Additionally, we provide a new heuristic to embed universal and conjunctive goals within the framework of RMDP planners, expanding the scope and applicability of such systems. We show that these ideas lead to significant improvements in performance in terms of both speed and coverage of the planner, yielding state of the art planning performance on problems from the International Planning Competition.},

Many existing image search engines, however, present users with sets of images arranged in some default order on the screen, typically the relevance to a query, only. While this certainly has its advantages, arguably, a more flexible and intuitive way would be to sort images into arbitrary structures such as grids, hierarchies, or spheres so that images that are visually or semantically alike are placed together. This paper focuses on designing such a navigation system for image browsers. This is a challenging task because arbitrary layout structure makes it difficult -- if not impossible -- to compute cross-similarities between images and structure coordinates, the main ingredient of traditional layouting approaches. For this reason, we resort to a recently developed machine learning technique: kernelized sorting. It is a general technique for matching pairs of objects from different domains without requiring cross-domain similarity measures and hence elegantly allows sorting images into arbitrary structures. Moreover, we extend it so that some images can be preselected for instance forming the tip of the hierarchy allowing to subsequently navigate through the search results in the lower levels in an intuitive way.},

While it was already shown that active learning can effectively reduce the number of training pairs needed, the most successful existing algorithms cannot generalize over items or queries. Considering web search as an example, they would need to learn a separate relevance score for each document-query pair from scratch. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose a link-based active preference learning method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) that incorporates dependency information from both feature-vector representations as well as relations. Specifically, to meet the requirement on computational efficiency of active exploration, we introduce a novel incremental update method that scales as well as the non-generalizing models. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on datasets for information retrieval, showing that it learns substantially faster than algorithms that cannot model dependencies.},

Essentially, we select variables one at a time for conditioning, running lifted belief propagation after each selection. This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference. We show how to avoid this by efficiently computing the lifted network for each conditioning directly from the one already known for the single node marginals.

In this paper, we advocate to view this task as a problem of fast, large-scale retrieval.

However, actually carrying this out requires highly efficient ways of (1) storing millions of scan points in memory and (2) quickly finding similar scan points to a target scan point. In this paper, we propose to address both issues by employing Weiss et al.'s recent spectral hashing. It represents each item in a database by a compact binary code that is constructed so that similar items will have similar binary code words. In turn, similar neighbors have codes within a small Hamming distance of the code for the query. Then, we learn a logistic regression model locally over all points with the same binary code word.

There is, however, no free lunch: imposing convexity constraints on W typically prevents adaptation to intrinsic, low dimensional structures in the data. Alas, in cases where the data is distributed in a non-convex manner or consists of mixtures of lower dimensional convex distributions, the cluster representatives obtained from CH-NMF will be less meaningful. In this paper, we present a hierarchical CH-NMF that automatically adapts to internal structures of a dataset, hence it yields meaningful and interpretable clusters for non-convex datasets.

Surprisingly, kernel methods have not received attention yet although they are very popular in the machine learning community due to their solid mathematical foundation, tendency toward easy geometric interpretation, and strong empirical performance in a wide variety of domains. In this paper, we show how to employ kernels for map matching. Specifically, ignoring map constraints, we first maximize the consistency between the similarity measures captured by the kernel matrices of the trajectory and relevant part of the street map. The resulting relaxed assignment is then ''rounded'' into a hard assignment fulfilling the map constraints.

Recently, lifted belief propagation (LBP) has been proposed as an efficient approximate solution of this inference problem. It runs a modified BP on a lifted network where nodes have been grouped together if they have --- roughly speaking --- identical computation trees, the tree-structured unrolling of the underlying graph rooted at the nodes. In many situations, this purely syntactic criterion is too pessimistic: message errors decay along paths. Intuitively, for a long chain graph with weak edge potentials, distant nodes will send and receive identical messages yet their computation trees are quite different. To overcome this, we propose iLBP, a novel, easy-to-implement, informed LBP approach that interleaves lifting and modified BP iterations. In turn, we can efficiently monitor the true BP messages sent and received in each iteration and group nodes accordingly. As our experiments show, iLBP can yield significantly faster more lifted network while not degrading performance. Above all, we show that iLBP is faster than BP when solving the problem of distributing data to a large network, an important real-world application where BP is faster than uninformed LBP.},

A centralized controller then learns to coordinate their behavior by optimizing a weighted sum of reward functions of all the agents. We evaluate our approach on a traffic-routing domain, in which a controller coordinates actions of multiple traffic signals to regulate traffic density. We show that the learner is not only able to match but even significantly outperform the expert.},

	note = {Mechanical ventilation is the live-saving therapy in intensive care medicine by all means. Nevertheless, it can induce severe mechanical stress to the lung, which generally impairs the outcome of the therapy. To reduce the risk of a ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), lung protective ventilation is essential, especially for patients with a previous medical history like the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The prerequisite for lung protective ventilation approaches is the knowledge about the physical behavior of the human lung under the condition of mechanical ventilation. This knowledge is commonly described by mathematical models. Diverse models have been introduced to represent particular aspects of mechanical characteristics of the lung. A commonly accepted general model is the equation of motion, which relates the airway pressure to the airflow and the volume applied by the ventilator and describes the influence of the distensibility and resistance of the respiratory system. Equation Discovery systems extract mathematical models from observed time series data. To reduce the vast search space associated with this task, the LAGRAMGE-system introduced the application of declarative bias in Equation Discovery, which furthermore allows the presentation of domain specific knowledge. We introduce a modification of this system and apply it to data obtained during mechanical ventilation of ARDS-patients. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that the equation of motion model can automatically be rediscovered from real-world data.},

Popular examples include the Singular Value Decomposition or Non-negative Matrix Factorization.

In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for the factorization of gigantic matrices that iteratively yields latent components. We consider a constrained matrix factorization s.t.~the latent components form a simplex that encloses most of the remaining data. The algorithm maximizes the volume of that simplex and thereby reduces the displacement of data from the space spanned by the latent components. Hence, it also lowers the Frobenius norm, a common criterion for matrix factorization quality. Our algorithm is efficient, well-grounded in distance geometry, and easily applicable to matrices with billions of entries. In addition, the resulting factors allow for an intuitive interpretation of data: every data point can now be expressed as a convex combination of the most extreme and thereby often most descriptive instances in a collection of data. Extensive experimental validations on web-scale data, including 80 million images and 1.5 million twitter tweets, demonstrate superior performance compared to related factorization or clustering techniques.},

Infinite hidden relational models (IHRMs) introduce nonparametric mixture models into relational learning and have been successful in many relational applications. In this paper we explore the modeling and analysis of complex social networks with IHRMs for community detection, link prediction and product recommendation. In an IHRM-based social network model, each edge is associated with a random variable and the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables are specified by the model, based on the relational structure. The hidden variables, one for each object, are able to transport information such that non-local probabilistic dependencies can be obtained. The model can be used to predict entity attributes, to predict relationships between entities and it performs an interpretable cluster analysis. We demonstrate the performance of IHRMs with three social network applications. We perform community analysis on the Sampson's monastery data and perform link analysis on the Bernard & Killworth data. Finally we apply IHRMs to the MovieLens data for prediction of user preference on movies and for an analysis of user clusters and movie clusters.},

Then it runs a modified BP algorithm on the compressed graph that is equivalent to running BP on the original factor graph.

	note = {First order decision diagrams (FODD) were recently introduced as a compact knowledge representation expressing functions over relational structures. FODDs represent numerical functions that, when constrained to the Boolean range, use only existential quantification. Previous work developed a set of operations over FODDs, showed how they can be used to solve relational Markov decision processes (RMDP) using dynamic programming algorithms, and demonstrated their success in solving stochastic planning problems from the International Planning Competition in the system FODD-Planner. A crucial ingredient of this scheme is a set of operations to remove redundancy in decision diagrams, thus keeping them compact. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and combination algorithms for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a particularly promising case where an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers is followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers. Third, we develop a new approach to reduce FODDs and GFODDs using model checking. This yields a reduction that is complete for FODDs and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs.},

	note = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

In this paper, we describe a non-parametric policy gradient approach -- called NPPG -- that overcomes this limitation. The key idea is to apply Friedmann's gradient boosting: policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models grown in an stage-wise optimization. Employing off-the-shelf regression learners, NPPG can deal with propositional, continuous, and relational domains in a uni- fied way.

	note = {The task of aligning sequences arises in many applications. Classical dynamic programming approaches require the explicit state enumeration in the reward model. This is often impractical: the number of states grows very quickly with the number of domain objects and relations among these objects. Relational sequence alignment aims at exploiting symbolic structure to avoid the full enumeration. This comes at the expense of a more complex reward model selection problem: virtually infinitely many abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we apply gradientbased boosting to leverage this problem. Specifically, we show how to reduce the learning problem to a series of relational regressions problems. The main benefit of this is that interactions between states variables are introduced only as needed, so that the potentially infinite search space is not explicitly considered. As our experimental results show, this boosting approach can significantly improve upon established results in challenging applications.},

The major benefit of our approach is its ability to generalize over entire range scans directly. This way, we can learn the distributions of range measurements for whole regions of the robot's configuration space from only few recorded or simulated range scans. Especially in approximative approaches to state estimation like particle filtering or histogram filtering, this leads to a better approximation of the true likelihood function. Experiments on real world and synthetic data show that Gaussian beam processes combine the advantages of two popular measurement models.},

First, it allows a mobile robot to imitate navigation behavior shown by users or by optimal policies. Second, it yields comprehensible models of behavior. Finally, a navigation policy learned in one environment naturally transfers to unknown environments. In several experiments with real robots and in simulated runs, we demonstrate that our approach yields efficient navigation plans.

	note = {Navigation is one of the fundamental tasks for a mobile robot. The majority of path planning approaches has been designed to entirely solve the given problem from scratch given the current and goal configurations of the robot. Although these approaches yield highly efficient plans, the computed policies typically do not transfer to other, similar tasks. We propose to learn relational decision trees as abstract navigation strategies from example paths. Relational abstraction has several interesting and important properties. First, it allows a mobile robot to generalize navigation plans from specific examples provided by users or exploration. Second, the navigation policy learned in one environment can be transferred to unknown environments. In several experiments with real robots in a real environment and in simulated runs, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.},

For classification, however, it is well-known that the performance of such generative models is often lower than that of discriminative classifiers. One approach to improve the performance of generative models is to combine them with discriminative algorithms. Fisher kernels were developed to combine them with kernel methods, and have shown promising results for the combinations of support vector machines with (logical) hidden Markov models and Bayesian networks. So far, however, Fisher kernels have not been considered for relational data, i.e., data consisting of a collection of objects and relational among these objects. In this paper, we develop Fisher kernels for relational data and empirically show that they can significantly improve over the results achieved without Fisher kernels.},

Naturally, global approaches are computationally more demanding than local ones. Moreover, for large data sets, approximate inference has to be performed to make computations feasible. In the present work, we investigate the benefits of collective classification based on global probabilistic models over local approaches. Our experimental results show that global approaches do not always outperform local approaches with respect to the classification accuracy. More precisely, the results suggest that global approaches considerably outperform local approaches only for low ratios of labeled data.},

We will answer this question empirically. More specifically, we first adapt scaled conjugate gradients well-known from neural network learning. This accelerated conjugate gradient avoids the time consuming line search of more traditional methods. Secondly, we empirically compare scaled conjugate gradients with EM. The experiments show that accelerated conjugate gradients are competitive with EM. Although, in general EM is the domain independent method of choice, gradient-based methods can be superior.},

In the study, we compared different methods of measuring pressure--volume curves in artificially ventilated patients suffering from the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our aim was to show that inductive machine learning can be used to gain insights into differences and similarities among these methods. We defined two tasks: the first one was to recognize the measurement method producing a given pressure--volume curve. This was defined as the task of classifying pressure--volume curves (the classes being the measurement methods). The second was to model the curves themselves, that is, to predict the volume given the pressure, the measurement method and the patient data. Clearly, this can be defined as a regression task. For these two tasks, we applied C5.0 and CUBIST, two inductive machine learning tools, respectively. Apart from medical findings regarding the characteristics of the measurement methods, we found some evidence showing the value of an abstract representation for classifying curves: normalization and high-level descriptors from curve fitting played a crucial role in obtaining reasonably accurate models. Another useful feature of algorithms for inductive machine learning is the possibility of incorporating background knowledge. In our study, the incorporation of patient data helped to improve regression results dramatically, which might open the door for the individual respiratory treatment of patients in the future.},

They are a probabilistic extension of propositional logic and, hence, inherit some of the limitations of propositional logic, such as the difficulties to represent objects and relations. We introduce a generalization of Bayesian networks, called Bayesian logic programs, to overcome these limitations. In order to represent objects and relations it combines Bayesian networks with definite clause logic by establishing a one-to-one mapping between ground atoms and random variables. We show that Bayesian logic programs combine the advantages of both definite clause logic and Bayesian networks. This includes the separation of quantitative and qualitative aspects of the model. Furthermore, Bayesian logic programs generalize both Bayesian networks as well as logic programs. So, many ideas developed in both areas carry over.},

The Neural Concept Binder facilitates straightforward concept inspection and direct integration of external knowledge, such as human input or insights from other AI models like GPT-4.
