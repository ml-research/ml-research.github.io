    Note = {Making sense of a dataset in an automatic, unsupervised fashion is a challenging problem in statistics
      and AI. For example, classical approaches for density estimation do not naturally deal with heterogeneous
      statistical data types, do not automatically select suitable parametric forms for the likelihood models, and,
      in basic formulations, are sensitive to corrupted data and outliers. To overcome this, we propose to extend
      density estimation to Automatic Bayesian Density Analysis (ABDA), casting both data modeling and selection of adequate likelihood models (statistical data types) into a joint inference problem. Specifically, we advocate a hierarchically structured mixture model, which explicitly incorporates arbitrarily rich collections of likelihood models and corresponding latent selection variables, and captures variable interactions by a latent hierarchical structure obtained from data-type agnostic structure learning. To account for prediction uncertainty, selection of parametric likelihood models and
      statistical data types, we employ Bayesian inference over a model formulated as a sum-product network,
      naturally providing the aforementioned expressiveness and flexibility, while facilitating exact and tractable
      inference.},

We show how to construct an FPGA-based accelerator for the inference in (mixed) SPNs. Starting from an input description of
the network, we develop a fully automatic synthesis flow to a custom FPGA-accelerator. The synthesized accelerator and its
interface to the external memory on the FPGA are fully pipelined, and computations are conducted using double-precision floating
point arithmetic.  To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first approach to offload the (mixed) SPN inference problem to FPGA-based
accelerators. Our evaluation shows that the SPN inference problem can profit from offloading to an FPGA accelerator.},

Our interdisciplinary group will present approaches to compare press releases from different

      Note = {The advent of industry 4.0 and the availability of large data storage systems lead to an increasing demand
for specially educated data-oriented professionals in industrial production. The education of such specialists
is supposed to combine elements from the three fields of engineering, data analysis and data administration.
Data administration skills are demanded to handle big data in diverse storage structures in data bases.
In order to extract knowledge from the stored data the proficient handling of data analysis tools - especially
machine learning - is essential. Finally, industrial domain knowledge is important to identify possible applications
for machine learning algorithms (and to interpret the results). However, to the best knowledge of the authors, an education program incorporating
elements of all three fields has not yet been established (in Germany).

In the context of the newly acquired project "Industrial Data Science" (InDaS) we aim to develop a qualification
concept for machine learning in industrial production targeted at two different groups. On the one hand advanced
students from any of the three fields mentioned above and on the other hand experienced professionals working in
industrial production. For the first group a one term lecture is going to be designed while coping with different
levels of knowledge in the inhomogeneous audience. It will be followed by a seminar with focus on use cases delivered
by partners from industrial production. Separately a workshop concept for the second target group will be developed
taking into account the strong domain knowledge of the participants.

The contents of the qualification concept should be selected according to the needs of industrial companies.
Therefore a survey was created to inquire the use and potentials of machine learning and the requirements for future
employees in industrial production. The evaluation of the survey and the resulting conclusions affecting the qualification
concept are going to be presented in this talk.},

    Booktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the 23rd European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-ECAI)},
    Note = {In recent years, weighted model counting (WMC) has become the de facto work-horse for logically-structured inference tasks.
      Problems ranging over probabilistic inference, planning, game theory, and numerical optimization have been tackled successfully using WMC technology.
      Weighted model integration (WMI) is a recent formalism generalizing WMC to the integration of functions over models of mixed discrete-continuous theories.
      WMI has already shown tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic programs.
      Yet, state of the art tools for WMI are nowhere as versatile as those for WMC--solvers are generally limited either by the range of amenable theories, or in terms of performance.
      Moreover, the data structures to represent, compose, and transform formulas over mixed theories have not reached the efficiency of their Boolean counterparts.
      Arguably, the latter is one of the prime reasons why WMC is so widely applicable.
      To address both limitations, we propose the use of extended algebraic decision diagrams (XADDs) as a compilation language for WMI.
      Aside from tackling typical WMI problems XADDs also enable partial WMI yielding parametrized solutions.
      To overcome the main roadblock of XADDs---the computational cost of variable elimination---we formulate a novel and powerful exact symbolic dynamic programming (SDP)
      algorithm that unlike its predecessor is able to effectively cache partial computations and seamlessly handle Boolean, integer-valued, and real variables.
      Our empirical results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can lead to an exponential to linear computational reduction in the best case and that it exceeds or
      matches state-of-the-art WMI solvers in terms of performance.

        Combining multisets with lifting makes it possible to simultaneously exploit multiple strategies

        core idea is to borrow the concept of Maximally Parallel Multiset Rewriting Systems and to enhance
        it by concepts from Rao-Blackwellisation and Lifted Inference, giving a representation of state
        distributions that enables efficient inference. In worlds where the random variables that define
        the system state are exchangeable - where the identity of entities does not matter - it automatically
        uses a representation that abstracts from ordering (achieving an exponential reduction

        exchangeability by breaking symmetry.},

      Note = {We present a model for recursive Bayesian filtering based on lifted multiset states.
        Combining multisets with lifting makes it possible to simultaneously exploit multiple strategies
        for reducing inference complexity when compared to list-based grounded state representations. The
        core idea is to borrow the concept of Maximally Parallel Multiset Rewriting Systems and to enhance
        it by concepts from Rao-Blackwellisation and Lifted Inference, giving a representation of state
        distributions that enables efficient inference. In worlds where the random variables that define
        the system state are exchangeable - where the identity of entities does not matter - it automatically
        uses a representation that abstracts from ordering (achieving an exponential reduction
        in complexity) and it automatically adapts when observations or system dynamics destroy
        exchangeability by breaking symmetry.},

    Note = {Movement Primitives are a well studied and
widely applied concept in modern robotics. Composing primitives
out of an existing library, however, has shown to be
a challenging problem. We propose the use of probabilistic
context-free grammars to sequence a series of primitives to
generate complex robot policies from a given library of primitives.
The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an
intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured
tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way
robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However,
the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a
complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit
the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict
and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is
learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the
posteriors of the grammars given the observations. Restrictions
over operators connecting the search define the corresponding
proposal distributions and, therefore, guide the optimization
additionally. In experiments, we validate our method on a
redundant 7 degree-of-freedom lightweight robotic arm on tasks
that require the generation of complex sequences of motions out
of simple primitives.},

      to public and commercial data ‚Äî are collected and stored, building probabilistic graphical models for
      these hybrid domains becomes more difficult. Users spend significant amounts of time in identifying the
      parametric form of the random variables (Gaussian, Poisson, Logit, etc.) involved and learning the mixed
      models. To make this difficult task easier, we propose the first trainable probabilistic deep
      architecture for hybrid domains that features tractable queries. It is based on Sum-Product Networks (SPNs)
      with piecewise polynomial leave distributions together with novel nonparametric decomposition and
      conditioning steps using the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R√©nyi Maximum Correlation Coefficient. This relieves
      the user from deciding a-priori the parametric form of the random variables but is still expressive
      enough to effectively approximate any continuous distribution and permits efficient learning and inference.
      Our empirical evidence shows that the architecture, called Mixed SPNs, can indeed capture complex distributions
      across a wide range of hybrid domains.},

        relationships between variables. But how can we train graphical models on a massive data set? In this paper,
        we show how to construct coresets ‚Äî compressed data sets which can be used as proxy for the original data and
        have provably bounded worst case error ‚Äî for Gaussian dependency networks (DNs), i.e., cyclic directed graphical
        models over Gaussians, where the parents of each variable are its Markov blanket. Specifically, we prove that
        Gaussian DNs admit coresets of size independent of the size of the data set. Unfortunately, this does not
        extend to DNs over members of the exponential family in general. As we will prove, Poisson DNs do not admit
        small coresets. Despite this worst-case result, we will provide an argument why our coreset construction for
        DNs can still work well in practice on count data. To corroborate our theoretical results, we empirically
        evaluated the resulting Core DNs on real data sets. The results demonstrate significant gains over no or naive
        sub-sampling, even in the case of count data.},
