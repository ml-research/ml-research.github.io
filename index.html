                    <p><b>Big Data is no fad</b>. The world is growing at an exponential rate, and so is the size of data collected across the globe. Data is
                        becoming more meaningful and contextually relevant, breaks new ground for machine learning (ML), in particular for deep learning (DL),
                        and artificial intelligence (AI), and even moves them from research labs to production [1]. The problem has shifted from
                        collecting massive amounts of data to understanding it - turning it into knowledge, conclusions, and actions.
                        Multiple research disciplines, from cognitive sciences to biology, finance, physics, and the social sciences, as well
                        as many companies believe that data-driven and "intelligent" solutions are necessary in order to solve many of their key problems. <b>However,
                            are AI, ML and DL really the same things, as suggested by many
                            recent news, blogs and media?</b> For example, when AlphaGo [2]
                        defeated South Korean Master Lee Se-dol in the board game Go in 2016, the terms AI, ML, and DL were used in the media to describe how
                        AlphaGo won.
                        AI and ML are very much related.
                    <p>According to, e.g., Stanford's John McCarthy [3], one of the founders of the field,
                        <b>AI is "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the
                            similar task of using
                            computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically
                            observable." </b>
                        This is fairly generic and includes all kinds of tasks such as abstractly reasoning and generalizing about the world, solving puzzles,
                        planning how to achieve goals, moving around in the world, recognizing objects and sounds, speaking, translating, performing social or
                        business transactions, creative work (e.g. making art or poetry), and controlling robots.
                        And, the behavior of a machine is not just the outcome of the program, it is also affected by its "body" and the enviroment it is
                        physically embedded in. To keep it simple, however,
                        if you can write a very clever program that has, say, human-like behavior, it can be AI. But unless it is automatically learned from
                        data, it is not ML:
                        <b> ML is the science that is "concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with
                            experience"</b>,
                        following, e.g., CMU's Tom Mitchell [4].</p>
                    <p>So, <b>AI and ML are both about constructing intelligent computer programs</b>, and deep learning, being an instance of machine learning,
                        is no exception.
                        Deep learning [5, 6], which has achieved remarkable gains in many domains spanning object recognition, speech recognition, and control,
                        can be viewed as constructing computer programs, namely programming layers of abstraction in a differentiable way using reusable
                        structures such as convolution, pooling,
                        auto encoders, variational inference networks, and so on. That is, we replace the complexity of writing algorithms that cover every
                        eventuality with the complexity of
                        finding the right general outline of the algorithms - in the form of e.g. a deep neural network - and processing data. By virtue of the
                        generality of neural
                        networks - they are general function approximators - training them is data hungry and coming up with the right architecture and data is
                        notoriously difficult. Benchmark training sets for object recognition store hundreds or thousands of examples per class. Learning to
                        play video games may require
                        hundreds of hours of training experience and/or very expensive compute power.
                        In contrast, writing an algorithm that covers every eventuality of a task we want to solve - say, computing the shortest way to get to
                        an airport - is a lot of manual
                        work but we know what the algorithm does by design and we can study and understand more easily the complexity of the problem it solves.
                        Especially when a machine has to
                        interact with a human, this seems to be valuable.</p>
                    <p><b>This illustrates that ML and AI are indeed very similar, but not quite the same.</b> The easiest way to think of their relationship is
                        to visualize them as concentric
                        circles with AI first and ML sitting inside (with DL fitting inside both), since <b>ML also requires to write algorithms that cover
                            every eventuality, namely, of the learning process</b>.
                        The crucial point is that <b>they share the idea of using computation as the language for intelligent behaviour</b>. What kind of
                        computation and how to program it? That remains an open question.
                        Computation neither rules out search, logical, probabilistic and constraint programming techniques nor (deep) (un)supervised and
                        reinforcement learning methods, among others,
                        as computational models do contain all of them. Reconsider AlphaGo. AlphaGo and its successor AlphaGo Zero [7] both combine deep
                        learning and tree search - ML and AI.
                        Or consider the "Allen AI Science Challenge" [8]. The task is to comprehend a paragraph that states a science problem at the middle
                        school level and then answer a multiple-choice question.
                        The winning models all employed ML but did not pass yet the test at the level of a competent middle schooler. All winners argued it was
                        clear that applying a deeper, semantic level of reasoning
                        with scientific knowledge to the question and answers, i.e., AI would be the key to achieving true intelligence. That is, we have to
                        cover knowledge, reasoning, and learning, whether just
                        programmed or learning-based programmed. </p>

                        <p> Moreover, along the lines of Berkeley's Michael Jordan [9], while the building block have begun to emerge, the principles for putting these
                          blocks together have not yet emerged. However, statistical relational learning [10], probabilistic programming [11], and learning-based programming [12]
                          may provide good starting points for developing <b>Systems AI</b> - the computational and mathematical modeling of complex AI systems - and in turn
                          an <b>engineering discpline for AI and ML</b>.</p>

        <b> Mission.</b> The Machine Learning lab would like to make computers learn so much about the world,
        so rapidly and flexibly, as humans. This poses many deep and fascinating scientific problems:
        How can computers learn with less help from us and data? How can computers reason about and learn with complex
        data such as graphs and uncertain databases? How can pre-existing knowledge be exploited? How can computers
        decide autonomously which representation is best for the data at hand? Can learned results be physically
        plausible or be made understandable by us? How can computers learn together with us in the loop?
        To this end, we develop novel machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, i.e., novel
        computational methods that contain and combine for example search, logical and probabilistic
        techniques as well as (deep) (un)supervised and reinforcement learning methods.

                        In this DFG project, we will investigate radically novel machine learning approaches in detail and develop
                        the new field of “argumentative machine learning” in general: a tight integration of Computational
                        Argumentation and Machine Learning. This has several benefits. The use of argumentation
                        techniques allows to obtain classifiers, which are by design able to explain their decisions, and
                        therefore addresses the recent need for Explainable AI : classifications are accompanied by a
                        dialectical analysis showing why arguments for the conclusion are preferred to counterarguments;
                        this automatic deliberation, validation, reconstruction and synthesis of arguments helps in assessing
                        trust in the classifier, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction.
                        Argumentation techniques in machine learning also allows the easy integration of additional expert
                        knowledge in form of arguments.

                            Say we know that some people in a social network are friends and some are smokers, how can we infer whether others are smokers
                            and friends? For thousands of people this seems like a daunting computational task. However, such tasks often have strong
                            symmetries (i.e.,repeated structures) that should intuitively translate into fewer computations. In this project, we proposed a
                            novel approach to designing “symmetry aware” algorithms. We built on linear programming (LP) relaxations as the key underlying
                            framework. Despite the popularity of LP relaxations in the graphical models community, they have seen very little use within the
                            SRL literature. In this GIF project, we developed the theory and algorithms needed for applying LPs to SRL, while making
                            effective use of symmetries.

                            The core approach of this DFG project is to organize
                            exploration, learning and inference on appropriate relational representations implying strong
                            prior assumptions on the world structure. On these representations we can learn from uncertain
                            experience compact models of action effects that generalize across objects. We transfer existing
                            exploration theories to relational representations—leading to a novel level of explorative behavior
                            that decidedly aims to explore objects to which the current knowledge does not generalize. This
                            project was to our knowledge the first to combine statistical relational learning methods to tackle
                            core problems in intelligent robotics, fueling the hope for a major advance in the field. We have demonstrated
                            our methods on real-world robot platforms manipulating their environments.

                            The ability to build computing systems that can observe, understand and act on
                            human activity has long been a goal of computing research. Such systems could
                            have profound conceptual and practical implications. Since the ability to reason
                            and act based on activity is one of the central aspects of human intelligence,
                            from a conceptual viewpoint such a system could cast light on computational
                            models of intelligence. More tangibly, perhaps, machines that reason about
                            human activity could aid humans in aspects of their lives that are today
                            considered outside the domain of machines.
                            <br>
                            Most existing activity mining approaches indeed take uncertainties into account,
                            but they do not consider the rich relations among people and objects that exist
                            in the real world. STREAM’s goal was to develop formalisms, models, and
                            algorithms for effective and robust statistical relational activity mining that
                            enables one to develop socio-cognitive aware systems and to apply them on
                            significant real-life applications. To this aim STREAM develop statistical relational learning methods using a Fraunhofer
                            ATTRACT fellowship.

                            One of the key open questions of artificial intelligence concerns "probabilistic logic learning", i.e.the integration of
                            probabilistic reasoning, with first order logic representations and machine learning. The overall goal of the APrIL II project
                            is therefore to develop a sound theoretical understanding of "probabilistic logic learning" that enables one to develop
                            effective probabilistic logic learning systems and to apply them on significant real-life applications. To realize this aim, the
                            APrIL II consortium will (1) develop a number of significant "show-case" applications of "probabilistic logic learning" in the
                            area of bio-informatics, more specifically, concerning protein folding, metabolic pathways, and genetics.(2) develop the needed
                            theory, probabilistic representations, learning algorithms and systems for learning interesting probabilistic logic models in
                            real-life applications on the basis of data. The methodology applied is that of the field of inductive logic programming, which
                            explains the title of the project.
