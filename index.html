                    <p class="text-justify"><b>Big Data is no fad</b>. The world is growing at an exponential rate, and
                        so is the size of data collected across the globe. Data is
                        becoming more meaningful and contextually relevant, breaks new ground for machine learning (ML),
                        in particular for deep learning (DL),
                        and artificial intelligence (AI), and even moves them from research labs to production [1]. The
                        problem has shifted from
                        collecting massive amounts of data to understanding it - turning it into knowledge, conclusions,
                        and actions.
                        Multiple research disciplines, from cognitive sciences to biology, finance, physics, and the
                        social sciences, as well
                        as many companies believe that data-driven and "intelligent" solutions are necessary in order to
                        solve many of their key problems. <b>However,
                            are AI, ML and DL really the same things, as suggested by many
                            recent news, blogs and media?</b> For example, when AlphaGo [2]
                        defeated South Korean Master Lee Se-dol in the board game Go in 2016, the terms AI, ML, and DL
                        were used in the media to describe how
                        AlphaGo won.
                        AI and ML are very much related.
                    <p class="text-justify">According to, e.g., Stanford's John McCarthy [3], one of the founders of the
                        field,
                        <b>AI is "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent
                            computer programs. It is related to the
                            similar task of using
                            computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to
                            methods that are biologically
                            observable." </b>
                        This is fairly generic and includes all kinds of tasks such as abstractly reasoning and
                        generalizing about the world, solving puzzles,
                        planning how to achieve goals, moving around in the world, recognizing objects and sounds,
                        speaking, translating, performing social or
                        business transactions, creative work (e.g. making art or poetry), and controlling robots.
                        And, the behavior of a machine is not just the outcome of the program, it is also affected by
                        its "body" and the enviroment it is
                        physically embedded in. To keep it simple, however,
                        if you can write a very clever program that has, say, human-like behavior, it can be AI. But
                        unless it is automatically learned from
                        data, it is not ML:
                        <b> ML is the science that is "concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs
                            that automatically improve with
                            experience"</b>,
                        following, e.g., CMU's Tom Mitchell [4].
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">So, <b>AI and ML are both about constructing intelligent computer
                        programs</b>, and deep learning, being an instance of machine learning,
                        is no exception.
                        Deep learning [5, 6], which has achieved remarkable gains in many domains spanning object
                        recognition, speech recognition, and control,
                        can be viewed as constructing computer programs, namely programming layers of abstraction in a
                        differentiable way using reusable
                        structures such as convolution, pooling,
                        auto encoders, variational inference networks, and so on. That is, we replace the complexity of
                        writing algorithms that cover every
                        eventuality with the complexity of
                        finding the right general outline of the algorithms - in the form of e.g. a deep neural network
                        - and processing data. By virtue of the
                        generality of neural
                        networks - they are general function approximators - training them is data hungry and coming up
                        with the right architecture and data is
                        notoriously difficult. Benchmark training sets for object recognition store hundreds or
                        thousands of examples per class. Learning to
                        play video games may require
                        hundreds of hours of training experience and/or very expensive compute power.
                        In contrast, writing an algorithm that covers every eventuality of a task we want to solve -
                        say, computing the shortest way to get to
                        an airport - is a lot of manual
                        work but we know what the algorithm does by design and we can study and understand more easily
                        the complexity of the problem it solves.
                        Especially when a machine has to
                        interact with a human, this seems to be valuable.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify"><b>This illustrates that ML and AI are indeed very similar, but not quite
                        the same.</b> The easiest way to think of their relationship is
                        to visualize them as concentric
                        circles with AI first and ML sitting inside (with DL fitting inside both), since <b>ML also
                            requires to write algorithms that cover
                            every eventuality, namely, of the learning process</b>.
                        The crucial point is that <b>they share the idea of using computation as the language for
                            intelligent behaviour</b>. What kind of
                        computation and how to program it? That remains an open question.
                        Computation neither rules out search, logical, probabilistic and constraint programming
                        techniques nor (deep) (un)supervised and
                        reinforcement learning methods, among others,
                        as computational models do contain all of them. Reconsider AlphaGo. AlphaGo and its successor
                        AlphaGo Zero [7] both combine deep
                        learning and tree search - ML and AI.
                        Or consider the "Allen AI Science Challenge" [8]. The task is to comprehend a paragraph that
                        states a science problem at the middle
                        school level and then answer a multiple-choice question.
                        The winning models all employed ML but did not pass yet the test at the level of a competent
                        middle schooler. All winners argued it was
                        clear that applying a deeper, semantic level of reasoning
                        with scientific knowledge to the question and answers, i.e., AI would be the key to achieving
                        true intelligence. That is, we have to
                        cover knowledge, reasoning, and learning, whether just
                        programmed or learning-based programmed. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify"> Moreover, along the lines of Berkeley's Michael Jordan [9], while the
                        building block have begun to emerge, the principles for putting these
                        blocks together have not yet emerged. However, statistical relational learning [10],
                        probabilistic programming [11], and learning-based programming [12]
                        may provide good starting points for developing <b>Systems AI</b> - the computational and
                        mathematical modeling of complex AI systems - and in turn
                        an <b>engineering discpline for AI and ML</b>.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><b> AIML Mission.</b> The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning lab would like to
            make computers learn so much about the world,
            so rapidly and flexibly, as humans. This poses many deep and fascinating scientific problems:
            How can computers learn with less help from us and data? How can computers reason about and learn with
            complex
            data such as graphs and uncertain databases? How can pre-existing knowledge be exploited? How can computers
            decide autonomously which representation is best for the data at hand? Can learned results be physically
            plausible or be made understandable by us? How can computers learn together with us in the loop?
            To this end, we develop novel machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, i.e., novel
            computational methods that contain and combine for example search, logical and probabilistic
            techniques as well as (deep) (un)supervised and reinforcement learning methods.</p>

                    <div class="ppd">

                        In this DFG project, we will investigate radically novel machine learning approaches in detail
                        and develop
                        the new field of ‚Äúargumentative machine learning‚Äù in general: a tight integration of
                        Computational
                        Argumentation and Machine Learning. This has several benefits. The use of argumentation
                        techniques allows to obtain classifiers, which are by design able to explain their decisions,
                        and
                        therefore addresses the recent need for Explainable AI : classifications are accompanied by a
                        dialectical analysis showing why arguments for the conclusion are preferred to counterarguments;
                        this automatic deliberation, validation, reconstruction and synthesis of arguments helps in
                        assessing
                        trust in the classifier, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction.
                        Argumentation techniques in machine learning also allows the easy integration of additional
                        expert
                        knowledge in form of arguments.

                        will

                        Say we know that some people in a social network are friends and some are smokers, how can we
                        infer whether others are smokers
                        and friends? For thousands of people this seems like a daunting computational task. However,
                        such tasks often have strong
                        symmetries (i.e.,repeated structures) that should intuitively translate into fewer computations.
                        In this project, we proposed a
                        novel approach to designing ‚Äúsymmetry aware‚Äù algorithms. We built on linear programming (LP)
                        relaxations as the key underlying
                        framework. Despite the popularity of LP relaxations in the graphical models community, they have
                        seen very little use within the
                        SRL literature. In this GIF project, we developed the theory and algorithms needed for applying
                        LPs to SRL, while making
                        effective use of symmetries.

                        Flexible Skill Acquisition and Intuitive Robot Tasking for Mobile Manipulation in the Real World
                        was a project funded by the
                        European Commission within FP7. The goal of First-MM is to build the basis for a new generation
                        of autonomous mobile
                        manipulation robots that can flexibly be instructed to perform complex manipulation and
                        transportation tasks. The project has
                        focussed on developing a novel robot programming environment that allows even non-expert users
                        to specify complex manipulation
                        tasks in real-world environments. To this aim, we have built upon and extend results in robot
                        programming, navigation,
                        manipulation, perception, learning by instruction, and statistical relational learning to
                        develop advanced technology for mobile
                        manipulation robots that can flexibly be instructed even by non-expert users to perform
                        challenging manipulation tasks in
                        real-world environments.

                        The core approach of this DFG project is to organize
                        exploration, learning and inference on appropriate relational representations implying strong
                        prior assumptions on the world structure. On these representations we can learn from uncertain
                        experience compact models of action effects that generalize across objects. We transfer existing
                        exploration theories to relational representations‚Äîleading to a novel level of explorative
                        behavior
                        that decidedly aims to explore objects to which the current knowledge does not generalize. This
                        project was to our knowledge the first to combine statistical relational learning methods to
                        tackle
                        core problems in intelligent robotics, fueling the hope for a major advance in the field. We
                        have demonstrated
                        our methods on real-world robot platforms manipulating their environments.

                        The ability to build computing systems that can observe, understand and act on
                        human activity has long been a goal of computing research. Such systems could
                        have profound conceptual and practical implications. Since the ability to reason
                        and act based on activity is one of the central aspects of human intelligence,
                        from a conceptual viewpoint such a system could cast light on computational
                        models of intelligence. More tangibly, perhaps, machines that reason about
                        human activity could aid humans in aspects of their lives that are today
                        considered outside the domain of machines.
                        <br>
                        Most existing activity mining approaches indeed take uncertainties into account,
                        but they do not consider the rich relations among people and objects that exist
                        in the real world. STREAM‚Äôs goal was to develop formalisms, models, and
                        algorithms for effective and robust statistical relational activity mining that
                        enables one to develop socio-cognitive aware systems and to apply them on
                        significant real-life applications. To this aim STREAM develop statistical relational learning
                        methods using a Fraunhofer
                        ATTRACT fellowship.

                        One of the key open questions of artificial intelligence concerns "probabilistic logic
                        learning", i.e.the integration of
                        probabilistic reasoning, with first order logic representations and machine learning. The
                        overall goal of the APrIL II project
                        is therefore to develop a sound theoretical understanding of "probabilistic logic learning" that
                        enables one to develop
                        effective probabilistic logic learning systems and to apply them on significant real-life
                        applications. To realize this aim, the
                        APrIL II consortium will (1) develop a number of significant "show-case" applications of
                        "probabilistic logic learning" in the
                        area of bio-informatics, more specifically, concerning protein folding, metabolic pathways, and
                        genetics.(2) develop the needed
                        theory, probabilistic representations, learning algorithms and systems for learning interesting
                        probabilistic logic models in
                        real-life applications on the basis of data. The methodology applied is that of the field of
                        inductive logic programming, which
                        explains the title of the project.
