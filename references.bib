	note         = {The recent surge in popularity of text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) can largely be attributed to the versatile, expressive, and intuitive user interfaces provided through textual prompts. These models enable inexperienced people to explore artistic ventures easily and provide exciting new opportunities to experienced artists. However, the semantic control offered through text prompts alone is limited and rather fragile, and overall lacks the fine granularity necessary for creative applications. The majority of methods addressing this issue are restricted to specific DM architectures, severely limiting the creative workflow instead of generalizing it to arbitrary models. In contrast, we demonstrate that semantic guidance (SEGA) generalizes to any DM architecture. Importantly, SEGA is natively compatible with state-of-the-art diffusion transformers. Our empirical results show strong model-agnostic performance, and we highlight new creative possibilities enabled by SEGA, such as enhanced typographic manipulations. This work underscores SEGA’s potential to provide consistent, high-quality semantic guidance in a rapidly evolving generative model landscape.},

To remedy these issues, we propose T-FREE, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets, and does not require a reference corpus. T-FREE inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers.

Importantly, this refers to base systems that have no predetermined application or deployment context, including a model itself, as well as system components, such as training data. Our framework for a base system defines seven categories of social impact: bias, stereotypes, and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data and content moderation labor costs. Suggested methods for evaluation apply to listed generative modalities and analyses of the limitations of existing evaluations serve as a starting point for necessary investment in future evaluations. We offer five overarching categories for what can be evaluated in a broader societal context, each with its own subcategories: trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization, and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and environment.

One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names and faces of individuals from vision-language models by fine-tuning them for only a few minutes instead of re-training them from scratch. Specifically, through strategic insertion of backdoors into text encoders, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's actual name. For image encoders, we map embeddings of individuals to be removed from the model to a universal, anonymous embedding. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.},

This hinders the flexible incorporation of expertise and valuable knowledge of domain experts, which might provide partial feedback at any time during optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel Bayesian optimization approach leveraging tractable probabilistic models named probabilistic circuits (PCs) as surrogate model. PCs encode a tractable joint distribution over the hybrid hyperparameter space and enable exact conditional inference and sampling, allowing users to provide valuable insights interactively and generate configurations adhering to their feedback.

Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks.

Specifically, they allow users to perform interventional interactions on these concepts by updating the concept values and thus correcting the predictive output of the model. Traditionally, however, these interventions are applied to the model only once and discarded afterward. To rectify this, we present concept bottleneck memory models (CB2M), an extension to CBMs. Specifically, a CB2M learns to generalize interventions to appropriate novel situations via a two-fold memory with which it can learn to detect mistakes and to reapply previous interventions. In this way, a CB2M learns to automatically improve model performance from a few initially obtained interventions. If no prior human interventions are available, a CB2M can detect potential mistakes of the CBM bottleneck and request targeted interventions. In our experimental evaluations on challenging scenarios like handling distribution shifts and confounded training data, we illustrate that CB2M are able to successfully generalize interventions to unseen data and can indeed identify wrongly inferred concepts. Overall, our results show that CB2M is a great tool for users to provide interactive feedback on CBMs, e.g., by guiding a user's interaction and requiring fewer interventions.},

Inspired by residual networks, we derive a condition under which rational units are closed under residual connections and formulate a naturally regularised version. The proposed joint-rational activation allows for desirable degrees of flexibility, yet regularises plasticity to an extent that avoids overfitting by leveraging a mutual set of activation function parameters across layers.

Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters MIAs, thereby increasing a model's privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, beating state-of-the-art defenses.

Many prominent DAG learners rely on least square losses or log-likelihood losses for optimization. It is well-known from regression models that least square losses are heavily influenced by the scale of the variables. Recently it has been demonstrated that the scale of data also affects performance of structure learning algorithms, though with a strong focus on linear 2-node systems and simulated data. Moving beyond these results, we provide conditions under which square-based losses are minimal for wrong DAGs in -dimensional cases. Furthermore, we also show that scale can impair performance of structure learners if relations among variables are non-linear for both square based and log-likelihood based losses.

To tackle both the generalizability and interpretability constraints of visual concept learning, we propose Pix2Code, a framework that extends program synthesis to visual relational reasoning by utilizing the abilities of both explicit, compositional symbolic and implicit neural representations. This is achieved by retrieving object representations from images and synthesizing relational concepts as λ-calculus programs. We evaluate the diverse properties of Pix2Code on the challenging reasoning domains, Kandinsky Patterns and CURI, thereby testing its ability to identify compositional visual concepts that generalize to novel data and concept configurations. Particularly, in stark contrast to neural approaches, we show that Pix2Code’s representations remain human interpretable and can be easily revised for improved performance.},

A neural network is used to estimate the parameters of the learned iSPN using the intervened data. Our experiments on 3 synthetic heterogeneous datasets suggest that SPN can effectively capture the interventional distributions for both discrete and continuous variables while being expressive and causally adequate. We also show that chiSPN generalize to multiple interventions while being trained only on a single intervention data.},

However, motivated primarily by privacy and computational constraints, the fact that data may change, distributions drift, or even tasks advance individually on clients, is seldom taken into account. The field of continual learning addresses this separate challenge and first steps have recently been taken to leverage synergies in distributed settings of a purely supervised nature. Motivated by these prior works, we posit that such federated continual learning should be grounded in unsupervised learning of representations that are shared across clients; in the loose spirit of how humans can indirectly leverage others' experience without exposure to a specific task. For this purpose, we demonstrate that masked autoencoders for distribution estimation are particularly amenable to this setup. Specifically, their masking strategy can be seamlessly integrated with task attention mechanisms to enable selective knowledge transfer between clients. We empirically corroborate the latter statement through several continual federated scenarios on both image and binary datasets.},

We can further improve the robustness of such explanations by measuring their likelihood within a mutually agreed-upon causal model. For this, typically one of in-principle two distinct types of counterfactual explanations is used: interventional counterfactuals, which treat changes as deliberate interventions to the causal system, and backtracking counterfactuals, which attribute changes exclusively to exogenous factors. Although both frameworks share the common goal of inferring true causal factors, they fundamentally differ in their conception of counterfactuals.

We construct such a dataset and demonstrate empirically that standard continual learning methods fail to ignore confounders, while training jointly on all tasks is successful.

Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) have been instrumental in modeling such relationships, using directed, acyclic links between nodes in a network to depict probabilistic associations between variables. Deviations from these graphical models’ edicts would result in biased judgments. This study explores one such bias in the causal judgments of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) by examining two structures in CBNs: Canonical Chain (A→B→C) and Common Cause (A←B→C) networks. In these structures, once the intermediate variable (B) is known, the probability of the outcome (C) is normatively independent of the initial cause (A). However, studies have shown that humans often ignore this independence. We tested the mutually exclusive predictions of three theories that could account for this bias (N=300). Using hierarchical mixed-effect models, we found that humans tend to perceive causes in Chain structures as significantly stronger, providing support for only one of the hypotheses. This increase in perceived causal power might reflect a view of intermediate causes as more reflective of reliable mechanisms, which could, in turn, stem from our interactions with the world or the way we communicate causality to others.  LLMs are primarily trained on language data. Therefore, examining whether they exhibit similar biases in causal reasoning can help us understand the origins of canonical Chain structures’ perceived causal power while also shedding light on whether LLMs can abstract causal principles. To investigate this, we subjected three LLMs, GPT3.5-Turbo, GPT4, and Luminous Supreme Control, to the same queries as our human subjects, adjusting a key ‘temperature’ hyperparameter. Our findings show that, particularly with higher temperatures (i.e., greater randomness), LLMs exhibit a similar boost in the perceived causal power of Chains, suggesting the bias is at least partly reflected in language use. Similar results across items suggest a degree of causal principle abstraction in the studied models. Implications for causal representation in humans and LLMs are discussed.},

Utilizing the First Divergent Token Metric (FDTM) in model sparsification reveals that 25% of all attention components can be pruned beyond 90% on the Llama-2 model family, still keeping SOTA performance. For quantization FDTM suggests that over 80% of parameters can naively be transformed to int8 without special outlier management. These evaluations indicate the necessity of choosing appropriate compressions for parameters individually---and that FDTM can identify those---while standard metrics result in deteriorated outcomes.},

This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context, CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare research, or autonomous driving. In essence, our work advances distributed machine learning, shaping the future of collaborative GenAI networks.},

Our methodology employs a suite of specialized models, each designed to respond to specific changes in the game's input data. This results in a framework with sparsely activated models, which provides significant computational benefits. Our framework combines the MoE method with MCTS, in order to align it with the strategic phases of chess, thus departing from the conventional ``one-for-all'' model. Instead, we utilize distinct game phase definitions to effectively distribute computational tasks across multiple expert neural networks. Our empirical research shows a substantial improvement in playing strength, surpassing the traditional single-model framework. This validates the efficacy of our integrated approach and highlights the potential of incorporating expert knowledge and strategic principles into neural network design. The fusion of MoE and MCTS offers a promising avenue for advancing machine learning architectures.},

Addressing this gap, we investigate whether common publicly available LLMs have inherent capabilities to perturb text samples to fool safety measures, so-called adversarial examples resp. attacks. More specifically, we investigate whether LLMs are inherently able to craft adversarial examples out of benign samples to fool existing safe rails. Our experiments, which focus on hate speech detection, reveal that LLMs succeed in finding adversarial perturbations, effectively undermining hate speech detection systems. Our findings carry significant implications for (semi-)autonomous systems relying on LLMs, highlighting potential challenges in their interaction with existing systems and safety measures.},

Such behavior can be interpreted as a model feature, offering users a simple way to customize the image generation and reflect their own cultural background.

Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) have been instrumental in modeling such relationships, using directed, acyclic links between nodes in a network to depict probabilistic associations between variables. Deviations from these graphical models’ edicts would result in biased judgments. This study explores one such bias in the causal judgments of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) by examining two structures in CBNs: Canonical Chain (A→B→C) and Common Cause (A←B→C) networks. In these structures, once the intermediate variable (B) is known, the probability of the outcome (C) is normatively independent of the initial cause (A). However, studies have shown that humans often ignore this independence. We tested the mutually exclusive predictions of three theories that could account for this bias (N=300). Using hierarchical mixed-effect models, we found that humans tend to perceive causes in Chain structures as significantly stronger, providing support for only one of the hypotheses. This increase in perceived causal power might reflect a view of intermediate causes as more reflective of reliable mechanisms, which could, in turn, stem from our interactions with the world or the way we communicate causality to others.  LLMs are primarily trained on language data. Therefore, examining whether they exhibit similar biases in causal reasoning can help us understand the origins of canonical Chain structures’ perceived causal power while also shedding light on whether LLMs can abstract causal principles. To investigate this, we subjected three LLMs, GPT3.5-Turbo, GPT4, and Luminous Supreme Control, to the same queries as our human subjects, adjusting a key ‘temperature’ hyperparameter. Our findings show that, particularly with higher temperatures (i.e., greater randomness), LLMs exhibit a similar boost in the perceived causal power of Chains, suggesting the bias is at least partly reflected in language use. Similar results across items suggest a degree of causal principle abstraction in the studied models. Implications for causal representation in humans and LLMs are discussed.},

Our proposed methodology, denoted as AmEx-MCTS, solves this problem by introducing a novel MCTS formulation. Central to AmEx-MCTS is the decoupling of value updates, visit count updates, and the selected path during the tree search, thereby enabling the exclusion of already explored subtrees or leaves. This segregation preserves the utility of visit counts for both exploration-exploitation balancing and quality metrics within MCTS. The resultant augmentation facilitates in a considerably broader search using identical computational resources, preserving the essential characteristics of MCTS. The expanded coverage not only yields more precise estimations but also proves instrumental in larger and more complex problems. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of AmEx-MCTS, surpassing classical MCTS and related approaches by a substantial margin.},

Peers are allowed to communicate only about their own states and actions recommended by others: &quot;What would you do in my situation?&quot;. Our motivation is to study the learning behavior of these agents. We formalize the teacher selection process in the action advice setting as a multi-armed bandit problem and therefore highlight the need for exploration. Eventually, we analyze the learning behavior of the peers and observe their ability to rank the agents’ performance within the study group and understand which agents give reliable advice. Further, we compare peer learning with single agent learning and a state-of-the-art action advice baseline. We show that peer learning is able to outperform single-agent learning and the baseline in several challenging discrete and continuous OpenAI Gym domains. Doing so, we also show that within such a framework complex policies from action recommendations beyond discrete action spaces can evolve.},

Yet, as we will show, multilingual models suffer similarly from (gender) biases as monolingual models. Furthermore, the natural expectation is that these models will provide similar results across languages, but this is not the case and there are important differences between languages. Thus, we propose a novel benchmark MAGBIG intending to foster research in multilingual models without gender bias. We investigate whether multilingual T2I models magnify gender bias with MAGBIG. To this end, we use multilingual prompts requesting portrait images of persons of a certain occupation or trait (using adjectives). Our results show not only that models deviate from the normative assumption that each gender should be equally likely to be generated, but that there are also big differences across languages. Furthermore, we investigate prompt engineering strategies, i.e. the use of indirect, neutral formulations, as a possible remedy for these biases. Unfortunately, they help only to a limited extent and result in worse text-to-image alignment. Consequently, this work calls for more research into diverse representations across languages in image generators.},

Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.},

Trends of the global population of satellites need to be analyzed to test the viability and impact of proposed rules and laws affecting the satellite population and collision avoidance strategies. This requires large scale simulations of satellites that are propagated on long timescales to compute the large amounts of actionable close encounters (called conjunctions), which could lead to collisions. Rigorously checking for conjunctions by computing future states of orbits is computationally expensive due to the large amount of objects involved and conjunction filters are thus used to remove non-conjuncting orbit pairs from the list of possible conjunctions. In this work, we explore the possibility of machine learning (ML) based conjunction filters using several algorithms such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting, TabNet and (physics-informed) neural networks and deep operator networks. To show the viability and the potential of ML based filters, these algorithms are trained to predict the future state of orbits. For the physics-informed approaches, multiple partial differential equations are set up using the Kepler equation as a basis. The empirical results demonstrate that physics-informed deep operator networks are capable of predicting the future state of orbits using these equations (RMSE: 0.136) and outperform eXtreme Gradient Boosting (RMSE: 0.568) and TabNet (RMSE: 0.459). We also propose a filter based on the trained deep operator network which is shown to outperforms the filter capability of the commonly used perigee-apogee test and the orbit path filter on a synthetic dataset, while being on average 3.2 times faster to compute than a rigorous conjunction check.},

On our initial attempt of a naïve mapping between the formalism of adversarial examples and LPs, we quickly identify the key ingredients missing for making sense of a reasonable notion of adversarial examples for LPs. Intriguingly, the formalism of Pearl's notion to causality allows for the right description of adversarial like examples for LPs. Characteristically, we show the direct influence of the Structural Causal Model (SCM) onto the subsequent LP optimization, which ultimately exposes a notion of confounding in LPs (inherited by said SCM) that allows for adversarial-style attacks. We provide both the general proof formally alongside existential proofs of such intriguing LP-parameterizations based on SCM for three combinatorial problems, namely Linear Assignment, Shortest Path and a real world problem of energy systems.},

PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic ruless. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for NeSy ILP systems that can handle visual input to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is relatively unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neural-symbolic approach, NeSy-𝜋, to invent predicates from visual scenes for NeSy ILP systems based on clustering and extension of relational concepts.

NeSy-𝜋 processes visual scenes as input using deep neural networks for the visual perception and invents new concepts that support the task of classifying complex visual scenes. The invented concepts can be used by any NeSy ILP systems instead of hand-crafted background knowledge. Our experiments show that the PI model is capable of inventing high-level concepts and solving complex visual logic patterns more efficiently and accurately in the absence of explicit background knowledge.Moreover, the invented concepts are explainable and interpretable, while also providing competitive results with state-of-the-art NeSy ILP systems based on given knowledge.},

To report potential risks along pipelines, several steps are taken such as manual inspection and helicopter flights; however, these solutions are expensive and the flights are environmentally unfriendly. Deep learning has demonstrated considerable potential in handling a number of tasks in recent years as models rely on huge datasets to learn a specific task. With the increasing number of satellites orbiting the Earth, remote sensing data have become widely available, thus paving the way for automated pipeline monitoring via deep learning. This can result in effective risk detection, thereby reducing monitoring costs while being more precise and accurate. A major hindrance here is the low resolution of images obtained from the satellites, which makes it difficult to detect smaller changes. To this end, we propose to use transformers trained with low-resolution images in a change detection setting to detect pipeline risks. We collect PlanetScope satellite imagery (3 m resolution) that captures certain risks associated with the pipelines and present how we collected the data. Furthermore, we compare various state-of-the-art models, among which ChangeFormer, a transformer architecture for change detection, achieves the best performance with a 70% F1 score. As part of our evaluation, we discuss the specific performance requirements in pipeline monitoring and show how the model’s predictions can be shifted accordingly during training.},

Unfortunately, current SGG methods suffer from an information loss regarding the entities' local-level cues during the relation encoding process. To mitigate this, we introduce the Vision rElation TransfOrmer (VETO), consisting of a novel local-level entity relation encoder. We further observe that many existing SGG methods claim to be unbiased, but are still biased towards either head or tail classes. To overcome this bias, we introduce a Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET) learning strategy that captures important relation features without bias towards head or tail classes. Experimental results on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that VETO + MEET boosts the predictive performance by up to 47\% over the state of the art while being 10x smaller.},

Nonetheless, most common self-play reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simply approximate   policy and value functions using convolutional neural networks (CNN). A key feature of CNNs is their relational inductive bias towards locality and translational invariance. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNN) can encode more complicated and distinct relational structures. Hence, we investigate the crucial question: Can GNNs, with their ability to encode complex connections, replace CNNs in self-play reinforcement learning? To this end, we do a comparison with Hex -- an abstract yet strategically rich board game -- serving as our experimental platform. Our findings reveal that GNNs excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in game states and are less prone to overfitting, but also showing a reduced proficiency in discerning local patterns. This suggests a potential paradigm shift, signaling the use of game-specific structures to reshape self-play reinforcement learning.},

We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names of individuals from models, and focus in this work on text encoders. Specifically, through strategic insertion of backdoors, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's name. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.},

Detecting such poisoned samples within vast datasets is virtually impossible through manual inspection. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that enables model training on potentially poisoned datasets by utilizing the power of recent diffusion models. Specifically, we create synthetic variations of all training samples, leveraging the inherent resilience of diffusion models to potential trigger patterns in the data. By combining this generative approach with knowledge distillation, we produce student models that maintain their general performance on the task while exhibiting robust resistance to backdoor triggers.},

However, these models adopt cultural characteristics associated with specific Unicode scripts from their vast amount of training data, which may not be immediately apparent. We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in the textual description, common models reflect cultural biases in their generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively and identify a model’s text encoder as the root cause of the phenomenon. Such behavior can be interpreted as a model feature, offering users a simple way to customize the image generation and reflect their own cultural background. Yet, malicious users or service providers may also try to intentionally bias the image generation. One goal might be to create racist stereotypes by replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin scripts, so-called homoglyphs. To mitigate such unnoticed script attacks, we propose a novel homoglyph unlearning method to fine-tune a text encoder, making it robust against homoglyph manipulations},

	note         = {Artificial intelligence (AI) research has a long track record of drawing inspirations from findings from biology, in particular human intelligence. In contrast to current AI research that mainly treats explanations as a means for model inspection, a somewhat neglected finding from human psychology is the benefit of self-explaining in an agents' learning process. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel learning paradigm, termed Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX). The underlying idea is that a learning module (learner) performs a base task, e.g. image classification, and provides explanations to its decisions. An internal critic module next evaluates the quality of these explanations given the original task. Finally, the learner is refined with the critic's feedback and the loop is repeated as required. The intuition behind this is that an explanation is considered "good" if the critic can perform the same task given the respective explanation. Despite many implementation possibilities the structure of any LSX instantiation can be taxonomized based on four learning modules which we identify as: Fit, Explain, Reflect and Revise. In our work, we provide distinct instantiations of LSX for two different learner models, each illustrating different choices for the various LSX components. We broadly evaluate these on several datasets and show that Learning by Self-Explaining not only boosts the generalization abilities of AI models, particularly in small-data regimes, but also aids in mitigating the influence of confounding factors, as well as leading to more task specific and faithful model explanations. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence of the potential of self-explaining within the learning phase of an AI model.},

Specifically, they allow users to perform interventional interactions on these concepts by updating the concept values and thus correcting the predictive output of the model. Traditionally, however, these interventions are applied to the model only once and discarded afterward. To rectify this, we present concept bottleneck memory models (CB2M), an extension to CBMs. Specifically, a CB2M learns to generalize interventions to appropriate novel situations via a two-fold memory with which it can learn to detect mistakes and to reapply previous interventions. In this way, a CB2M learns to automatically improve model performance from a few initially obtained interventions. If no prior human interventions are available, a CB2M can detect potential mistakes of the CBM bottleneck and request targeted interventions. In our experimental evaluations on challenging scenarios like handling distribution shifts and confounded training data, we illustrate that CB2M are able to successfully generalize interventions to unseen data and can indeed identify wrongly inferred concepts. Overall, our results show that CB2M is a great tool for users to provide interactive feedback on CBMs, e.g., by guiding a user's interaction and requiring fewer interventions.},

However, said NCM are only concerned with the learning aspect of causal inference and totally miss out on the architecture aspect. That is, actual causal inference within NCM is intractable in that the NCM won’t return an answer to a query in polynomial time. This insight follows as corollary to the more general statement on the intractability of arbitrary structural causal model (SCM) parameterizations, which we prove in this work through classical 3-SAT reduction. Since future learning algorithms will be required to deal with both high dimensional data and highly complex mechanisms governing the data, we ultimately believe work on tractable inference for causality to be decisive. We also show that not all “causal” models are created equal. More specifically, there are models capable of answering causal queries that are not SCM, which we refer to as partially causal models (PCM). We provide a tabular taxonomy in terms of tractability properties for all of the different model families, namely correlation-based, PCM and SCM. To conclude our work, we also provide some initial ideas on how to overcome parts of the intractability of causal inference with SCM by showing an example of how parameterizing an SCM with SPN modules can at least allow for tractable mechanisms. With this work we hope that our insights can raise awareness for this novel research direction since achieving success with causality in real world downstream tasks will not only depend on learning correct models but also require having the practical ability to gain access to model inferences.},

This renders it difficult, if not impossible, to use explanations in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method relying on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics and models while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.},

This leaves the user with little semantic control. To put the user in control, we show how to interact with the diffusion process to flexibly steer it along semantic directions. This semantic guidance (SEGA) generalizes to any generative architecture using classifier-free guidance. More importantly, it allows for subtle and extensive edits, composition and style changes, and optimizing the overall artistic conception. We demonstrate SEGA’s effectiveness on both latent and pixel-based diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, Paella, and DeepFloyd-IF using a variety of tasks, thus providing strong evidence for its versatility and flexibility.},

Differentiable forward reasoning has been developed to integrate reasoning with gradient-based machine learning paradigms. However, due to the memory intensity, most existing approaches do not bring the best of the expressivity of first-order logic, excluding a crucial ability to solve abstract visual reasoning, where agents need to perform reasoning by using analogies on abstract concepts in different scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose NEUro-symbolic Message-pAssiNg reasoNer (NEUMANN), which is a graph-based differentiable forward reasoner, passing messages in a memory-efficient manner and handling structured programs with functors. Moreover, we propose a computationally-efficient structure learning algorithm to perform explanatory program induction on complex visual scenes. To evaluate, in addition to conventional visual reasoning tasks, we propose a new task, visual reasoning behind-the-scenes, where agents need to learn abstract programs and then answer queries by imagining scenes that are not observed. We empirically demonstrate that NEUMANN solves visual reasoning tasks efficiently, outperforming neural, symbolic, and neuro-symbolic baselines.},

Predicate Invention (PI) for ILP is the problem of discovering new concepts that describe hidden relationships in the domain. PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic ruless. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for NeSy ILP systems that can handle visual input to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is relatively unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neural-symbolic approach, NeSy-𝜋, to invent predicates from visual scenes for NeSy ILP systems based on clustering and extension of relational concepts. (𝜋 denotes the abbrivation of Predicate Invention). NeSy-𝜋 processes visual scenes as input using deep neural networks for the visual perception and invents new concepts that support the task of classifying complex visual scenes. The invented concepts can be used by any NeSy ILP systems instead of hand-crafted background knowledge. Our experiments show that the PI model is capable of inventing high-level concepts and solving complex visual logic patterns more efficiently and accurately in the absence of explicit background knowledge.Moreover, the invented concepts are explainable and interpretable, while also providing competitive results with state-of-the-art NeSy ILP systems based on given knowledge.},

Our evaluations demonstrate that even state-of-the-art AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations specific to each methodology.

This loop increases the training data and gradually carves out the VLM's rationalization capabilities that are aligned with human intend.

Unfortunately, this might not be the case. We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demonstrate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk. Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no suspicious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. By then inserting a single character trigger into the prompt, e.g., a non-Latin character or emoji, the adversary can trigger the model to either generate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description. We empirically demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attacks on Stable Diffusion and highlight that the injection process of a single backdoor takes less than two minutes. Besides phrasing our approach solely as an attack, it can also force an encoder to forget phrases related to certain concepts, such as nudity or violence, and help to make image generation safer.},

Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network evaluations, TDI provides tractable sampling-free uncertainty estimates in a single forward pass.

Rather than developing an explicit deep architecture, the resulting unsupervised Motion and Object Continuity (MOC) training scheme can be instantiated using any object detection model baseline. Our results show large improvements in the performances of variational and slot-based models in terms of object discovery, convergence speed and overall latent object representations, particularly for playing Atari games. Overall, we show clear benefits of integrating motion and object continuity for downstream reasoning tasks, moving beyond object representation learning based only on reconstruction as well as evaluation based only on instance segmentation quality.},

	note         = {Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands a deep understanding of legal, spatial and temporal concepts in navigation. Hence, any implementation of AAM is forced to deal with the inherent uncertainties of human-inhabited spaces. Enabling growth and innovation requires the creation of a system for safe and robust mission design, i.e., the way we formalise intentions and decide their execution as trajectories for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Although legal frameworks have emerged to govern urban airspaces, their full integration into the decision process of autonomous agents and operators remains an open task. In this work we present ProMis, a system architecture for probabilistic mission design. It links the data available from various static and dynamic data sources with legal text and operator requirements by following principles of formal verification and probabilistic modeling. Using ProMis, combining low-level perception and high-level rules in AAM can be applied to the navigation frame of the UAV. To this end, we employ Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) as a unifying, intermediate representation between perception and action-taking. Furthermore, we present methods to connect ProMis with crowd-sourced map data by generating HPLP atoms that represent spatial relations in a probabilistic fashion. Our claims of the utility and generality of ProMis are supported by experiments on a diverse set of scenarios and a discussion of the computational demands associated with probabilistic missions.},

Do the models exhibit random and thus potentially harmful beliefs in certain languages? Both these issues could negatively impact cross-lingual transfer and potentially lead to harmful outcomes.

AlphaZero-like frameworks which combine Monte-Carlo tree search with reinforcement learning have been successfully applied to numerous games with perfect information. However, they have not been developed for domains where uncertainty and unknowns abound, and are therefore often considered unsuitable due to imperfect observations. Here, we challenge this view and argue that they are a viable alternative for games with imperfect information—a domain currently dominated by heuristic approaches or methods explicitly designed for hidden information, such as oracle-based techniques. To this end, we introduce a novel algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, called AlphaZe**, which is an AlphaZero-based framework for games with imperfect information. We examine its learning convergence on the games Stratego and DarkHex and show that it is a surprisingly strong baseline, while using a model-based approach: it achieves similar win rates against other Stratego bots like Pipeline Policy Space Response Oracle (P2SRO), while not winning in direct comparison against P2SRO or reaching the much stronger numbers of DeepNash. Compared to heuristics and oracle-based approaches, AlphaZe** can easily deal with rule changes, e.g., when more information than usual is given, and drastically outperforms other approaches in this respect.},

	note         = {Approximate matching is a well-known concept in digital forensics to determine the similarity between digital artifacts.An important use case of approximate matching is the reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a blacklist (e.g., malware or corporate secrets), if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if only a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital forensic investigation, the approximate matching algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the blacklisted malware. However, traditional approximate matching functions like TLSH and ssdeep fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is relatively small compared to the overall file size (e.g., like one-third of the total file). A second well-known issue with traditional approximate matching algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the ever-increasing lookup databases. In this paper, we propose an improved matching algorithm based on transformer-based models from the field of natural language processing. We call our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM). As a concept from artificial intelligence, DLAM gets knowledge of characteristic blacklisted patterns during its training phase. Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in a typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment detection. Our evaluation is inspired by two widespread blacklist use cases: the detection of malware (e.g., in JavaScript) and corporate secrets (e.g., pdf or office documents). We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the prominent conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. First, it makes the tedious extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now before any search for them with approximate matching algorithms. This allows efficient classification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to exponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use case, DLAM achieves a similar (in case of mrsh-cf and mrsh-v2) or even significantly higher accuracy (in case of ssdeep and TLSH) in recovering fragments of blacklisted files. For instance, in the case of JavaScript files, our assessment shows that DLAM provides an accuracy of 93\% on our test corpus, while TLSH and ssdeep show a classification accuracy of only 50%. Third, we show that DLAM enables the detection of file correlations in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for fragment sizes, where the respective matching function of TLSH and ssdeep fails.},

We build upon recent successes of combining these two cuttingedge technologies and propose how Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning (XIL) is embedded in a generalizable Action Design Research (ADR) process – which we call XIL-ADR. This approach can be used to analyze data, inspect models, and iteratively improve them. We show the application of this process and use the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, e.g., Covid-19, as an illustrative example. By this means, this paper also illustrates how XIL-ADR can help identify shortcomings of standard machine learning projects, gain new insights on the part of the human user, and thereby help to tap the full potential of AI-based systems for organizations and research.},

	note         = {Large, text-conditioned generative diffusion models have recently gained a lot of attention for their impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images from text alone. However, achieving high-quality results is almost unfeasible in a one-shot fashion. On the contrary, text-guided image generation involves the user making many slight changes to inputs in order to iteratively carve out the envisioned image. However, slight changes to the input prompt often lead to entirely different images being generated, and thus the control of the artist is limited in its granularity. To provide flexibility, we present the Stable Artist, an image editing approach enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process. The main component is semantic guidance (SEGA) which steers the diffusion process along variable numbers of semantic directions. This allows for subtle edits to images, changes in composition and style, as well as optimization of the overall artistic conception. Furthermore, SEGA enables probing of latent spaces to gain insights into the representation of concepts learned by the model, even complex ones such as 'carbon emission'. We demonstrate the Stable Artist on several tasks, showcasing high-quality image editing and composition.},

Although the question has been identified as an interesting problem by the software community in online forums, it has not been investigated yet in adequate depth and scale, since the process of identifying the exact point in time when a vulnerability was introduced is particularly cumbersome. In this paper, we provide an automatic approach for accurately estimating how long vulnerabilities remain in the code (their lifetimes). Our method relies on the observation that while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact point of introduction for one vulnerability, it is possible to accurately estimate the average lifetime of a large enough sample of vulnerabilities, via a heuristic approach. With our approach, we perform the first large-scale measurement of Free and Open Source Software vulnerability lifetimes, going beyond approaches estimating lower bounds prevalent in previous research. We find that the average lifetime of a vulnerability is around 4 years, varying significantly between projects (~2 years for Chromium, ~7 years for OpenSSL). The distribution of lifetimes can be approximately described by an exponential distribution. There are no statistically significant differences between the lifetimes of different vulnerability types when considering specific projects. Vulnerabilities are getting older, as the average lifetime of fixed vulnerabilities in a given year increases over time, influenced by the overall increase of code age. However, they live less than non-vulnerable code, with an increasing spread over time for some projects, suggesting a notion of maturity that can be considered an indicator of quality. While the introduction of fuzzers does not significantly reduce the lifetimes of memory-related vulnerabilities, further research is needed to better understand and quantify the impact of fuzzers and other tools on vulnerability lifetimes and on the security of codebases.},

For an analysis of the site-specific wind conditions, Virtual Meteorological Masts (VMMs) are frequently used. VMMs make use of site calibrated numerical data to provide precise wind estimates during all phases of a wind energy project. Typically, numerical data are used for the long-term correlation that is required for estimating the yield of new wind farm projects. However, VMMs can also be used to fill data gaps or during the operational phase as an additional reference data set to detect degrading sensors. The value of a VMM directly depends on its ability and precision to reproduce site-specific environmental conditions. Commonly, linear regression is used as state of the art to correct reference data to the site-specific conditions. In this study, a framework of 10 different machine-learning methods is tested to investigated the benefit of more advanced methods on two offshore and one onshore site. We find significantly improving correlations between the VMMs and the reference data when using more advanced methods and present the most promising ones. The K-Nearest Neighbors and AdaBoost regressors show the best results in our study, but Multi-Output Mixture of Gaussian Processes is also very promising. The use of more advanced regression models lead to decreased uncertainties; hence those methods should find its way into industrial applications. The recommended regression models can serve as a starting point for the development of end-user applications and services.},

The changes in metabolites, for example chlorophyll or flavonoids, have long been detectable using time-consuming destructive analytical methods including high-performance liquid chromatography or photometric determination. Recent plant phenotyping studies have revealed that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the UV-range can be used to link spectral changes with changes in plant metabolites. To compare established destructive analytical methods with new non-destructive hyperspectral measurements, the interaction between sugar beet leaves and the pathogens Cercospora beticola, which causes Cercospora leaf spot disease (CLS), and Uromyces betae, which causes sugar beet rust (BR), was investigated. With the help of destructive analyses, we showed that both diseases have different effects on chlorophylls, carotenoids, flavonoids, and several phenols. Non-destructive hyperspectral measurements in the UV-range revealed different effects of CLS and BR on plant metabolites resulting in distinct reflectance patterns. Both diseases resulted in specific spectral changes that allowed differentiation between the two diseases. Machine learning algorithms enabled the differentiation between the symptom classes and recognition of the two sugar beet diseases. Feature importance analysis identified specific wavelengths important to the classification, highlighting the utility of the UV-range. The study demonstrates that HSI in the UV-range is a promising, non-destructive tool to investigate the influence of plant diseases on plant physiology and biochemistry.},

In this work, we depart from this mindset and argue that the goal of a precise formulation of desiderata is an ill-posed one, as diverse applications may always warrant distinct scenarios. Instead, we introduce the Continual Learning EValuation Assessment Compass, CLEVA-Compass for short. The compass provides the visual means to both identify how approaches are practically reported and how works can simultaneously be contextualized in the broader literature landscape. In addition to promoting compact specification in the spirit of recent replication trends, the CLEVA-Compass thus provides an intuitive chart to understand the priorities of individual systems, where they resemble each other, and what elements are missing towards a fair comparison.},

This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Plug \& Play Attacks that loosen the dependency between the target model and image prior and enable the use of a single trained GAN to attack a broad range of targets with only minor attack adjustments needed. Moreover, we show that powerful MIAs are possible even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong distributional shifts, whereas previous approaches fail to produce meaningful results. Our extensive evaluation confirms the improved robustness and flexibility of Plug \& Play Attacks and their ability to create high-quality images revealing sensitive class characteristics.},

We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures. Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since overconfidence leads to high false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked than previously assumed. Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of models and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know, making low confidence predictions, the more they reveal the training data.},

To mitigate this severe practical restriction, we introduce a novel framework for verifying neural networks, named neuro-symbolic verification. The key idea is to use neural networks as part of the otherwise logical specification, enabling the verification of a wide variety of complex, real-world properties, including the one above.

In this work, we introduce adaptable adapters that contain (1) learning different activation functions for different layers and different input data, and (2) a learnable switch to select and only use the beneficial adapter layers. We show that adaptable adapters achieve on-par performances with the standard adapter architecture while using a considerably smaller number of adapter layers. In addition, we show that the selected adapter architecture by adaptable adapters transfers well across different data settings and similar tasks. We propose to use adaptable adapters for designing efficient and effective adapter architectures. The resulting adapters (a) contain about 50% of the learning parameters of the standard adapter and are therefore more efficient at training and inference, and require less storage space, and (b) achieve considerably higher performances in low-data settings},

This way, the programmer can describe how to generate samples almost like in any standard programming language. The language takes care of computing the probability values of all results for free at run time. We demonstrate that SPLL inherits the beneficial properties of PCs, namely tractability and differentiability while generalizing to other distributions and programs.},

So far, this documentation, however, is done manually and therefore can be tedious and error-prone, especially for large image datasets. Here we ask the arguably "circular" question of whether a machine can help us reflect on inappropriate content, answering Question 16 in Datasheets. To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets -- ImageNet and OpenImages -- produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.},

Interpretation and anomaly attribution is critical and could improve the analysis and decision-making for many applications. With anomaly attribution, explanations can be leveraged to understand, on a per-anomaly basis, which sensors cause the root of anomaly and which features are the most important in causing an anomaly. To this end, we propose using saliency-based Explainable-AI approaches to localize the essential sensors responsible for anomalies in an unsupervised manner. While most Explainable AI methods are considered as interpreters of AI models, we show for the first time that Saliency Explainable AI can be utilized in Multi-sensor Anomaly localization applications. Our approach is demonstrated for localizing the detected anomalies in an unsupervised multi-sensor setup, and the experiments show promising results. We evaluate and compare different classes of saliency explainable AI approach on the Server Machine Data (SMD) Dataset and compared the results with the state-of-the-art OmniAnomaly Localization approach.

Although successful, these methods have mostly focused on the deep learning methods while the fundamental optimization methods in machine learning such as linear programs (LP) have been left out. Even if LPs can be considered as whitebox or clearbox models, they are not easy to understand in terms of relationships between inputs and outputs. As a linear program only provides the optimal solution to an optimization problem, further explanations are often helpful. In this work, we extend the attribution methods for explaining neural networks to linear programs. These methods explain the model by providing relevance scores for the model inputs, to show the influence of each input on the output. Alongside using classical gradient-based attribution methods we also propose a way to adapt perturbation-based attribution methods to LPs. Our evaluations of several different linear and integer problems showed that attribution methods can generate useful explanations for linear programs. However, we also demonstrate that using a neural attribution method directly might come with some drawbacks, as the properties of these methods on neural networks do not necessarily transfer to linear programs. The methods can also struggle if a linear program has more than one optimal solution, as a solver just returns one possible solution. Our results can hopefully be used as a good starting point for further research in this direction.},

Directedness indicates whether an attribution method gives feature attributions with respect to an increase of that feature.

Specifically, since structure discovery is a key problem in science and beyond, we want to be invariant to the scale being used for measuring our data (e.g. meter versus centimeter should not affect the causal direction inferred by the algorithm). In this work, we further strengthen this initial, negative empirical suggestion by both proving key results in the multivariate case and corroborating with further empirical evidence. In particular, we show that we can control the resulting graph with our targeted variance attacks, even in the case where we can only partially manipulate the variances of the data.},

	note         = {Deep generative models have seen a dramatic improvement in recent years, due to the use of alternative losses based on perceptual assessment of generated samples. This improvement has not yet been applied to the model class of probabilistic circuits (PCs), presumably due to significant technical challenges concerning differentiable sampling, which is a key requirement for optimizing perceptual losses. This is unfortunate, since PCs allow a much wider range of probabilistic inference routines than main-stream generative models, such as exact and efficient marginalization and conditioning. Motivated by the success of loss reframing in deep generative models, we incorporate perceptual metrics into the PC learning objective. To this aim, we introduce a differentiable sampling procedure for PCs, where the central challenge is the non-differentiability of sampling from the categorical distribution over latent PC variables. We take advantage of the Gumbel-Softmax trick and develop a novel inference pass to smoothly interpolate child samples as a strategy to circumvent non-differentiability of sum node sampling. We initially hypothesized, that  perceptual losses, unlocked by our novel differentiable sampling procedure, will elevate the generative power of PCs and improve their sample quality to be on par with neural counterparts like probabilistic auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks. Although our experimental findings empirically reject this hypothesis for now, the results demonstrate that samples drawn from PCs optimized with perceptual losses can have similar sample quality compared to likelihood-based optimized PCs and, at the same time, can express richer contrast, colors, and details. Whereas before, PCs were restricted to likelihood-based optimization, this work has paved the way to advance PCs with loss formulations that have been built around deep neural networks in recent years.},

Apart from introducing these novel benchmarking tasks, for improved quantitative evaluations, we further introduce a novel Wrong Reason (WR) metric which measures the average wrong reason activation in a model's explanations to complement a qualitative inspection. In our evaluations, all methods prove to revise a model successfully.

The computed ‘moral direction’ can rate the normativity (or non-normativity) of arbitrary phrases without explicitlytraining the LM for this task, reflecting social norms well.

However, the current tools are cumbersome not only for domain experts who are not fluent in machine learning but also for machine learning experts who evaluate new algorithms and models on real-world data and develop AI systems. We review key efforts made by various AI communities in providing languages for high-level abstractions over learning and reasoning techniques needed for designing complex AI systems. We classify the existing frameworks based on the type of techniques and their data and knowledge representations, compare the ways the current tools address the challenges of programming real-world applications and highlight some shortcomings and future directions.

A characteristic of these representations is that they give rise to a huge number of features to be considered, thus drastically increasing the difficulty of learning in terms of computational complexity and the curse of dimensionality. Despite this, methods for ranking features in this context, i.e., estimating their importance are practically non-existent. Among the most well-known methods for feature ranking are those based on ensembles, and in particular tree ensembles. To develop methods for feature ranking in a relational context, we adopt the relational tree ensemble approach. We thus first develop methods for learning ensembles of relational trees, extending a wide spectrum of tree-based ensemble methods from the propositional to the relational context, resulting in methods for bagging and random forests of relational trees, as well as gradient boosted ensembles thereof. Complex relational features are considered in our ensembles: by using complex aggregates, we extend the standard collection of features that correspond to existential queries, such as `Does this person have any children?', to more complex features that correspond to aggregation queries, such as `What is the average age of this person's children?'. We also calculate feature importance scores and rankings from the different kinds of relational tree ensembles learned, with different kinds of relational features. The rankings provide insight into and explain the ensemble models, which would be otherwise difficult to understand. We compare the methods for learning single trees and different tree ensembles, using only existential qualifiers and using the whole set of relational features, against 10 state-of-the-art methods on a collection of benchmark relational datasets, deriving also the corresponding feature rankings. Overall, the bagging ensembles perform the best, with gradient boosted ensembles following closely. The use of aggregates is beneficial and in some datasets drastically improves performance: In these cases, aggregate-based features clearly stand out in the feature rankings derived from the ensembles.},

Here we ask the arguably "circular" question of whether a machine can help us reflect on inappropriate content, answering Question 16 in Datasheets. To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets -- ImageNet and OpenImages -- produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.},

In particular, machine learning models have been shown to exhibit Clever-Hans-like behaviour, meaning that spurious correlations in the training set are inadvertently learnt. A number of works have been proposed to revise deep classifiers to learn the right correlations. However, generative models have been overlooked so far. We observe that generative models are also prone to Clever-Hans-like behaviour. To counteract this issue, we propose to debias generative models by disentangling their internal representations, which is achieved via human feedback. Our experiments show that this is effective at removing bias even when human feedback covers only a small fraction of the desired distribution. In addition, we achieve strong disentanglement results in a quantitative comparison with recent methods.},

Yet many existing approaches rely on the use of a set of fixed, preprogrammed joint configurations for expression generation. Automating this process provides potential advantages to scale better to different robot types and various expressions. To this end, we introduce ExGenNet, a novel deep generative approach for facial expressions on humanoid robots. ExGenNets connect a generator network to reconstruct simplified facial images from robot joint configurations with a classifier network for state-of-the-art facial expression recognition. The robots’ joint configurations are optimized for various expressions by backpropagating the loss between the predicted expression and intended expression through the classification network and the generator network. To improve the transfer between human training images and images of different robots, we propose to use extracted features in the classifier as well as in the generator network. Unlike most studies on facial expression generation, ExGenNets can produce multiple configurations for each facial expression and be transferred between robots. Experimental evaluations on two robots with highly humanlike faces, Alfie (Furhat Robot) and the android robot Elenoide, show that ExGenNet can successfully generate sets of joint configurations for predefined facial expressions on both robots. This ability of ExGenNet to generate realistic facial expressions was further validated in a pilot study where the majority of human subjects could accurately recognize most of the generated facial expressions on both the robots.},

This improvement has not yet been applied to the model class of probabilistic circuits (PCs), presumably due to significant technical challenges concerning differentiable sampling, which is a key requirement for optimizing perceptual losses. This is unfortunate, since PCs allow a much wider range of probabilistic inference routines than main-stream generative models, such as exact and efficient marginalization and conditioning. Motivated by the success of loss reframing in deep generative models, we incorporate perceptual metrics into the PC learning objective. To this aim, we introduce a differentiable sampling procedure for PCs, where the central challenge is the non-differentiability of sampling from the categorical distribution over latent PC variables. We take advantage of the Gumbel-Softmax trick and develop a novel inference pass to smoothly interpolate child samples as a strategy to circumvent non-differentiability of sum node sampling. Our hypothesis is that perceptual losses, unlocked by our novel differentiable sampling procedure, will elevate the generative power of PCs and improve their sample quality to be on par with neural counterparts like probabilistic auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks.},

The probability estimates resulting from NPPs act as the binding element between the logical program and raw input data, thereby allowing SLASH to answer task-dependent logical queries. This allows SLASH to elegantly integrate the symbolic and neural components in a unified framework. We evaluate SLASH on the benchmark data of MNIST addition as well as novel tasks for DPPLs such as missing data prediction and set prediction with state-of-the-art performance, thereby showing the effectiveness and generality of our method.},

With the recent success of deep learning, incorporating reasoning with deep learning systems, i.e., neuro-symbolic AI has become a major field of interest. We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Forward Reasoner (NSFR), a new approach for reasoning tasks taking advantage of differentiable forward-chaining using first-order logic. The key idea is to combine differentiable forward-chaining reasoning with object-centric (deep) learning. Differentiable forward-chaining reasoning computes logical entailments smoothly, i.e., it deduces new facts from given facts and rules in a differentiable manner. The object-centric learning approach factorizes raw inputs into representations in terms of objects. Thus, it allows us to provide a consistent framework to perform the forward-chaining inference from raw inputs. NSFR factorizes the raw inputs into the object-centric representations, converts them into probabilistic ground atoms, and finally performs differentiable forward-chaining inference using weighted rules for inference. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on object-centric reasoning data sets, 2D Kandinsky patterns and 3D CLEVR-Hans, and a variety of tasks show the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.},

To harness the expressive power of deep neural networks (DNNs), we also show how to realise CSPNs by conditioning the parameters of vanilla SPNs on the input using DNNs as gate functions. In experiments, we demonstrate that CSPNs are competitive with other probabilistic models and yield superior performance on structured prediction, conditional density estimation, auto-regressive image modeling, and multilabel image classification. In particular, we show that employing CSPNs as encoders and decoders within  variational autoencoders can help to relax the commonly used mean field assumption and in turn improve performance.},

Unfortunately, these approaches also entail severe risks. In particular, large image datasets automatically scraped from the web may contain derogatory terms as categories and offensive images, and may also underrepresent specific classes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to carefully document datasets and curate their content. Unfortunately, this process is tedious and error-prone. We show that pre-trained transformers themselves provide a methodology for the automated curation of large-scale vision datasets. Based on human-annotated examples and the implicit knowledge of a CLIP based model, we demonstrate that one can select relevant prompts for rating the offensiveness of an image. In addition to e.g. privacy violation and pornographic content previously identified in ImageNet, we demonstrate that our approach identifies further inappropriate and potentially offensive content.},

We introduce the first connection between relational rule models and probabilistic circuits, obtaining tractable inference from discriminative rule models while operating on the relational domain. Specifically, given a relational rule model, we make use of Mixed Sum-Product Networks (MSPNs)--—a deep probabilistic architecture for hybrid domains--—to equip them with a full joint distribution over the class and how (often) the rules fire. Our empirical evaluation shows that we can answer a widerange of probabilistic queries on relational data while being robust to missing, out-of-domain data and partial counts.

Given their accuracy performance, currently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the models of choice for this task. Despite their success in time series forecasting, less attention has been paid to make the RNNs trustworthy. For example, RNNs can not naturally provide an uncertainty measure to their predictions. This could be extremely useful in practice in several cases e.g. to detect when a prediction might be completely wrong due to an unusual pattern in the time series. Whittle Sum-Product Networks (WSPNs), prominent deep tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs) for time series, can assist an RNN with providing meaningful probabilities as uncertainty measure. With this aim, we propose RECOWN, a novel architecture that employs RNNs and a discriminant variant of WSPNs called Conditional WSPNs (CWSPNs). We also formulate a Log-Likelihood Ratio Score as an estimation of uncertainty that is tailored to time series and Whittle likelihoods. In our experiments, we show that RECOWNs are accurate and trustworthy time series predictors, able to "know when they do not know".},

	note         = {Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. While approaches for axis-aligned bounding box detection have made substantial progress in recent years, they perform poorly on oriented objects which are common in several realworld scenarios such as aerial view imagery and security camera footage. In these cases, a large part of a predicted bounding box will, undesirably, cover non-object related areas. Therefore, oriented object detection has emerged with the aim of generalizing object detection to arbitrary orientations. This enables a tighter fit to oriented objects, leading to a better separation of bounding boxes especially in case of dense object distributions. The vast majority of the work in this area has focused on complex two-stage anchor-based approaches, where the detection is split into a region-of-interest identification step followed by the object localization and classification based on sets of predefined bounding box anchors. These anchors act as priors on the bounding box shape and require attentive hyper-parameter fine-tuning on a perdataset basis, increased model size, and come with computational overhead. In this work, we present DAFNe: A Dense one-stage Anchor-Free deep Network for oriented object detection. As a one-stage model, DAFNe performs predictions on a dense grid over the input image, being architecturally simpler in design, as well as easier to optimize than its twostage counterparts. Furthermore, as an anchor-free model, DAFNe reduces the prediction complexity by refraining from employing bounding box anchors. Moreover, we introduce an orientation-aware generalization of the center-ness function for arbitrarily oriented bounding boxes to down-weight low-quality predictions and a center-to-corner bounding box prediction strategy that improves object localization performance. Our experiments show that, to the best of our knowledge, DAFNe outperforms all previous one-stage anchor-free models on DOTA 1.0. DAFNe improves the prediction accuracy over the previous best results by 4.65% mAP, setting the new state-of-the-art results by achieving 76.95% mAP.},

LLG is simple yet effective, capable of leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We empirically and mathematically demonstrate the validity of our attack under different settings. Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different defense mechanisms against such leakage.

A single forward pass of an encoder network outputs a set of latent vectors describing the objects in the scene. These vectors are used independently to condition a NeRF decoder, defining the geometry and appearance of each object. We make learning more computationally efficient by deriving a novel loss, which allows training NeRFs on RGB-D inputs without explicit ray marching. After confirming that the model performs equal or better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, we apply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and a novel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find that after training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of not only recovering the 3D geometry of a scene depicted in a single input image, but also to segment it into objects, despite receiving no supervision in that regard.},

These and other successes are exciting. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from degenerate and biased behaviour. While this is well established, we show that recent improvements of LMs also store ethical and moral values of the society and actually bring a ``moral dimension'' to surface: the values are capture geometrically by a direction in the embedding space, reflecting well the agreement of phrases to social norms implicitly expressed in the training texts. This provides a path for attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs. Since one can now rate the (non-)normativity of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, the moral dimension can be used as ``moral compass'' guiding (even other) LMs towards producing normative text, as we will show.},

A hyperspectral imaging set-up was established to highlight the influence of early plant-pathogen interactions on secondary plant metabolites. In this study, the plant-pathogen interactions of three different barley lines inoculated with Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh, powdery mildew) were carried out. One susceptible genotype (Ingrid wild type) and two resistant genotypes (Pallas 01, Mla1 and Mla12 based resistance and Pallas 22, mlo5 based resistance) were used. During the first 5 days after inoculation (dai) the plant reflectance patterns were recorded and in parallel plant metabolites relevant in host-pathogen interaction were studied. Hyperspectral measurements in the UV-range revealed that a differentiation between resistant and susceptible barley genotypes inoculated with Bgh is possible and distinct reflectance patterns were recorded for each genotype. The extracted and analyzed pigments and flavonoids correlated with the spectral data recorded. A classification of non-inoculated and inoculated samples with deep learning revealed that a high performance was achieved with self-attention networks. The subsequent feature importance identified wavelengths, which were most important for the classification, and these wavelengths were linked to pigments and flavonoids. Hyperspectral imaging in the UV-range allows for a characterisation of different resistance reactions, can be linked to changes of secondary plant metabolites with the advantage of being a non-invasive method and therefore enables a greater understanding of the plants' reaction to biotic stress as well as resistance reactions.},

Popular forms of explanations map the features to a vector indicating their individual importance to a decision on the instance-level. They can then be used to prevent the model from learning the wrong bias in data possibly due to ambiguity. For instance, Ross et al.'s "right for the right reasons" propagates user explanations backwards to the network by formulating differentiable constraints based on input gradients. Unfortunately, input gradients as well as many other widely used explanation methods form an approximation of the decision boundary and assume the underlying model to be fixed. Here, we demonstrate how to make use of influence functions - a well known robust statistic - in the constraints to correct the model’s behaviour more effectively. Our empirical evidence demonstrates that this "right for better reasons" (RBR) considerably reduces the time to correct the classifier at training time and boosts the quality of explanations at inference time compared to input gradients. Besides, we also showcase the effectiveness of RBR in correcting "Clever Hans"-like behaviour in real, high-dimensional domain.},

Providing an arbitrarily intervened causal graph as input, effectively subsuming Pearl's do-operator, the gate function predicts the parameters of the SPN. The resulting interventional SPNs are motivated and illustrated by a structural causal model themed around personal health.

The effective material behavior is assumed as hyperelastic, anisotropic and finite deformations are considered. A highly flexible analytical approach proposed by Itskov (2001) is taken into account, which ensures material objectivity and fulfillment of the material symmetry group conditions. Then, two non-intrusive data-driven approaches are proposed, which are built upon artificial neural networks and formulated such that they also fulfill the objectivity and material symmetry conditions. Finally, a hybrid approach combing the approach of Itskov (2001) with artificial neural networks is formulated. Here, all four models are calibrated with simulation data of the homogenization of two cubic lattice metamaterials at finite deformations. The data-driven models are able to reproduce the calibration data very well and reproduce the manifestation of lattice instabilities. Furthermore, they achieve superior accuracy over the analytical model also in additional test scenarios. The introduced hyperelastic models are formulated as general as possible, such that they can not only be used for lattice structures, but for any anisotropic hyperelastic material.

In contrast, deep probabilistic models such as sum-product networks (SPNs) capture joint distributions in a tractable fashion, but still lack the expressive power of intractable models based on deep neural networks. Therefore, we introduce conditional SPNs (CSPNs), conditional density estimators for multivariate and potentially hybrid domains that allow harnessing the expressive power of neural networks while still maintaining tractability guarantees. One way to implement CSPNs is to use an existing SPN structure and condition its parameters on the input, e.g., via a deep neural network. Our experimental evidence demonstrates that CSPNs are competitive with other probabilistic models and yield superior performance on multilabel image classification compared to mean field and mixture density networks. Furthermore, they can successfully be employed as building blocks for structured probabilistic models, such as autoregressive image models.},

The main trick is to ensemble SPNs by explicitly reformulating sum nodes as residual functions. This adds references to substructures across the SPNs at different depths, which in turn helps to improve training. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting residual SPNs (ResSPNs) are easy to optimize, gain performance from considerably increased depth and width, and are competitive to state-of-the-art SPN structure learning approaches.

The resulting non-parametric manner of learning the DACs results in a model with very few tuning parameters making our learned model significantly more efficient.

Unfortunately, both directions are currently rather challenging. For instance, combining deep neural models with logic typically only yields determinisic results, while combining probabilistic models with logic often results in intractable inference.

On synthetic and real data we illustrate how “arguing” with a deep model about its explanations can actually help to revise the model, if it is right for the wrong reasons.

In this paper, we propose Einsum Networks (EiNets), a novel implementation design for PCs, improving prior art in several regards. At their core, EiNets combine a large number of arithmetic operations in a single monolithic einsum-operation, leading to speedups and memory savings of up to two orders of magnitude, in comparison to previous implementations. As an algorithmic contribution, we show that the implementation of Expectation-Maximization (EM) can be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EiNets scale well to datasets which were previously out of reach, such as SVHN and CelebA, and that they can be used as faithful generative image models.},

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? In this study, we show that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about ``right" and ``wrong" conduct. We create a template list of prompts and responses, such as ``Should I [action]?'', ``Is it okay to [action]?'', etc. with corresponding answers of ``Yes/no, I should (not).'' and "Yes/no, it is (not)." The model's bias score is now the difference between the model's score of the positive response (``Yes, I should'') and that of the negative response (``No, I should not''). For a given choice, the model's overall bias score is the mean of the bias scores of all question/answer templates paired with that choice. Specifically, the resulting model, called the Moral Choice Machine (MCM), calculates the bias score on a sentence level using embeddings of the Universal Sentence Encoder since the moral value of an action to be taken depends on its context. It is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time. It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt. It is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and moral choices, even with context information. Actually, training the Moral Choice Machine on different temporal news and book corpora from year 1510 to 2008/09 demonstrate the evolution of moral and ethical choices over different time periods for both atomic actions and actions with context information. By training it on different cultural sources such as the Bible and the constitution of different countries, dynamics of moral choices in culture, including technology are revealed. That is the fact that moral biases can be extracted, quantified, tracked, and compared across cultures and over time.},

With this paper, we present CrazyAra which is a neural network based engine solely trained in supervised manner for the chess variant crazyhouse. Crazyhouse is a game with a higher branching factor than chess and there is only limited data of lower quality available compared to AlphaGo. Therefore, we focus on improving efficiency in multiple aspects while relying on low computational resources. These improvements include modifications in the neural network design and training configuration, the introduction of a data normalization step and a more sample efficient Monte-Carlo tree search which has a lower chance to blunder. After training on 569,537 human games for 1.5 days we achieve a move prediction accuracy of 60.4%. During development, versions of CrazyAra played professional human players. Most notably, CrazyAra achieved a four to one win over 2017 crazyhouse world champion Justin Tan (aka LM Jann Lee) who is more than 400 Elo higher rated compared to the average player in our training set. Furthermore, we test the playing strength of CrazyAra on CPU against all participants of the second Crazyhouse Computer Championships 2017, winning against twelve of the thirteen participants. Finally, for CrazyAraFish we continue training our model on generated engine games. In ten long-time control matches playing Stockfish 10, CrazyAraFish wins three games and draws one out of ten matches.},

The main focus of these works was to leverage the expressive power of deep neural networks within probabilistic programming systems. In particular, DeepProblog targets similar goals in the relational setting, by allowing probabilistic predicates to be specified as (conditional) distributions defined via deep neural networks. The resulting systems allow relational probabilistic models with deep components to be trained end-to-end. However, in this setting, deep models are used purely as conditional density estimators. This limits the types of inferences that are possible in the resulting system: Lacking any model for the inputs of the neural network, missing values can not be inferred or sampled. To overcome these obstacles we propose a novel deep relational probabilistic PL — "SPLog: Sum-Product Logic", the main components of which are Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and ProbLog. SPNs are a type of deep generative model with the crucial property that all conditional and marginal queries may be answered exactly in linear time. In this extended abstract, we show how to leverage this feature in the context of Problog, i.e., how to include SPNs as components within Problog programs, and how to perform joint training and inference.},

Using cryptographic techniques, it is possible to perform inference tasks remotely on sensitive client data in a privacy-preserving way: the server learns nothing about the input data and the model predictions, while the client learns nothing about the ML model (which is often considered intellectual property and might contain traces of sensitive data). While such privacy-preserving solutions are relatively efficient, they are mostly targeted at neural networks, can degrade the predictive accuracy, and usually reveal the network’s topology. Furthermore, existing solutions are not readily accessible to ML experts, as prototype implementations are not well-integrated into ML frameworks and require extensive cryptographic knowledge. In this paper, we present CryptoSPN, a framework for privacypreserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs). SPNs are a tractable probabilistic graphical model that allows a range of exact inference queries in linear time. Specifically, we show how to efficiently perform SPN inference via secure multi-party computation (SMPC) without accuracy degradation while hiding sensitive client and training information with provable security guarantees. Next to foundations, CryptoSPN encompasses tools to easily transform existing SPNs into privacy-preserving executables. Our empirical results demonstrate that CryptoSPN achieves highly efficient and accurate inference in the order of seconds for medium-sized SPNs.},

The main hindrance for achieving good performance for complex games is the data requirement for reinforcement learning and the associated hardware requirements. In this work we provide a throughout overview in applying reinforcement learning for the chess variant crazyhouse while aiming to reduce the amount of requireddata to achieve significant progress. Additionally, we present an extended input representation to support additional seven chess variants and evaluate whether it is advantageous to train a model for multiple variants at once. Lastly, the playing behaviour after 50th model updates in the reinforcement learning loop is evaluated in 100 matches between the latest development version of the strong open source chess engine Stockfish. We demonstrate that CrazyAra surpassed Stockfish in crazyhouse (61 wins, 3 draws, 36 defeats) by using one million self-play games which were generated in 18 days using three V100 GPUs when starting with a network trained on human games.},

Addressing this challenge, we propose novel recommender systems based on latent factor models that allow for recommending quests in a single player role-playing game. In particular, we introduce a tensor factorization algorithm to decompose collections of bipartite matrices which represent how players’ interests and behaviors change over time. Extensive online bucket type tests during the ongoing operation of a commercial game reveal that our system is able to recommend more engaging quests and to retain more players than previous handcrafted or collaborative filtering approaches.},

However, as Sum-Product Networks compute exact probability values, the required arithmetic precision poses different challenges than those encountered with Neural Networks. In previous work, this precision was maintained by using double-precision floating-point number formats, which are expensive to implement in FPGAs. In this work, we propose the use of a logarithmic number scale format tailored specifically towards the inference in Sum- Product Networks. The evaluation of our optimized arithmetic hardware operators shows that the use of logarithmic number formats allows to save up to 50% hardware resources compared to double-precision floating point, while maintaining sufficient precision for SPN inference and almost identical performance.},

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about "right" and "wrong" conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass? In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.},

Although starting from zero knowledge has been shown to yield impressive results, it is associated with high computationally costs especially for complex games. With this paper, we present CrazyAra which is a neural network based engine solely trained in supervised manner for the chess variant crazyhouse. Crazyhouse is a game with a higher branching factor than chess and there is only limited data of lower quality available compared to AlphaGo. Therefore, we focus on improving efficiency in multiple aspects while relying on low computational resources. These improvements include modifications in the neural network design and training configuration, the introduction of a data normalization step and a more sample efficient Monte-Carlo tree search which has a lower chance to blunder. After training on 569,537 human games for 1.5 days we achieve a move prediction accuracy of 60.4%. During development, versions of CrazyAra played professional human players. Most notably, CrazyAra achieved a four to one win over 2017 crazyhouse world champion Justin Tan (aka LM Jann Lee) who is more than 400 Elo higher rated compared to the average player in our training set. Furthermore, we test the playing strength of CrazyAra on CPU against all participants of the second Crazyhouse Computer Championships 2017, winning against twelve of the thirteen participants. Finally, for CrazyAraFish we continue training our model on generated engine games. In ten long-time control matches playing Stockfish 10, CrazyAraFish wins three games and draws one out of ten matches.},

To this end, we propose a ``classical deep learning approach'', i.e., generate an unspecialized random structure scaling up to millions of parameters, and then apply modern GPU-based optimizers with regularization. That is, we investigating the performance of SPNs in the absence of carefully selected structures. As it turns out, our models perform on par with state-of-the-art SPN structure learners and deep neural networks on a diverse range of generative and discriminative scenarios.

However, inference in the overall model is highly intractable, which hampers its learning speed and makes it prone to sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we show that inference and learning in AIR can be considerably accelerated by replacing the intractable object representations with tractable probabilistic models. In particular, we opt for sum-product (SP) networks, an expressive deep probabilistic model with a rich set of tractable inference routines. As our empirical evidence shows, the resulting model, called SuPAIR, achieves a higher object detection accuracy than the original AIR system, while reducing the learning time by an order of magnitude. Moreover, SuPAIR allows one to treat object occlusions in a consistent manner and to include a background noise model, improving the robustness of Bayesian scene understanding.},

The algorithm achieves its efficiency by performing inference jointly over groups of sim- ilar entities (i.e. their properties follow the same distribution). In this paper, we explore the case where there are no entities that are directly suitable for grouping. We propose to use methods from Gaussian mixture fitting to identify entity groups, such that the error imposed by grouping them (by approximating their properties by a distribution) is minimal. Furthermore, we show how Gaussian mixture merging methods can be used to prevent the number of groups from growing indefinitely over time. We evaluate our approach on an activity prediction task in an online multiplayer game. The results suggest that compared to the conventional approach, where all entities are handled individually, de- crease in prediction accuracy is small, while inference runtime decreases significantly.},

Observing plants in the UV-range can provide information about important changes of plant substances. To record reliable and reproducible time series results, measurement conditions were defined that exclude phototoxic effects of UV-illumination in the plant tissue. The measurement quality of the UV-camera has been assessed by comparing it to a non-imaging UV-spectrometer by measuring six different white-colored plant-based substances.

The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However, the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the posteriors of the grammars given the observations. Restrictions over operators connecting the search define the corresponding proposal distributions and, therefore, guide the optimization additionally. In experiments, we validate our method on a redundant 7 degree-of-freedom lightweight robotic arm on tasks that require the generation of complex sequences of motions out of simple primitives.},

To repair such broken loops, we propose a gradient-boosted method for structure learning of discriminative ACs (DACs), called DACBOOST. Since, in discrete domains, ACs are essentially equivalent to mixtures of trees, DACBOOST decomposes a large AC into smaller tree-structured ACs and learns them in a sequential, additive manner. The resulting non-parametric manner of learning the DACs results in a model with very few tuning parameters making our learned model significantly more efficient. We demonstrate on standard data sets and some real-world data sets, the efficiency of DACBOOST compared to the state-of-the-art DAC learners without sacrificing the effectiveness. This makes it possible to employ DACs for large scale real-world tasks.},

The library allows one to quickly create SPNs both from data and through a domain specific language (DSL). It efficiently implements several probabilistic inference routines like computing marginals, conditionals and (approximate) most probable explanations (MPEs) along with sampling as well as utilities for serializing, plotting and structure statistics on an SPN. Moreover, many of the algorithms proposed in the literature to learn the structure and parameters of SPNs are readily available in SPFlow. Furthermore, SPFlow is extremely extensible and customizable, allowing users to promptly distill new inference and learning routines by injecting custom code into a lightweight functional-oriented API framework. This is achieved in SPFlow by keeping an internal Python representation of the graph structure that also enables practical compilation of an SPN into a TensorFlow graph, C, CUDA or FPGA custom code, significantly speeding-up computations.},

In the past years, the database community has been working on different techniques for Approximate Query Processing (AQP) that aim to deliver an approximate query result given a fixed time bound to support interactive visualizations better. However, classical AQP approaches suffer from various problems that limit the applicability to support the ad-hoc exploration of a new data set: (1) Classical AQP approaches that perform online sampling can support ad-hoc exploration queries but yield low quality if executed over rare subpopulations. (2) Classical AQP approaches that rely on offline sampling can use some form of biased sampling to mitigate these problems but require a priori knowledge of the workload, which is often not realistic if users want to explore a new database. In this paper, we present a new approach to AQP called Model-based AQP that leverages generative models learned over the complete database to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds. Different from classical AQP approaches, generative models allow us to compute responses to ad-hoc queries and deliver high-quality estimates also over rare subpopulations at the same time. In our experiments with real and synthetic data sets, we show that Model-based AQP can in many scenarios return more accurate results in a shorter runtime. Furthermore, we think that our techniques of using generative models presented in this paper can not only be used for AQP in databases but also has applications for other database problems including Query Optimization as well as Data Cleaning.},

We create a template list of prompts and responses, which include questions, such as “Should I kill people?”, “Should I murder people?”, etc. with answer templates of “Yes/no, I should (not).” The model’s bias score is now the difference between the models score of the positive response (“Yes, I should”) and that of the negative response (“No, I should not”). For a given choice overall, the model’s bias score is the sum of the bias scores for all question/answer templates with that choice. We ran different choices through this analysis using a Universal Sentence Encoder. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and even moral choices. Our method holds promise for extracting, quantifying and comparing sources of moral choices in culture, including technology.},

Classical approaches for density estimation are usually not flexible enough to deal with the uncertainty inherent to real-world data: they are often restricted to fixed latent interaction models and homogeneous likelihoods; they are sensitive to missing, corrupt and anomalous data; and their expressiveness generally comes at the price of intractable inference. As a result, supervision from statisticians is usually needed to find the right model for the data. However, as domain experts do not necessarily have to be experts in statistics, we propose Automatic Bayesian Density Analysis (ABDA) to make density estimation accessible at large. ABDA automates the selection of adequate likelihood models from arbitrarily rich dictionaries while modeling their interactions via a deep latent structure adaptively learned from data as a sum-product network. ABDA casts uncertainty estimation at these local and global levels into a joint Bayesian inference problem, providing robust and yet tractable inference. Extensive empirical evidence shows that ABDA is a suitable tool for automatic exploratory analysis of heterogeneous tabular data, allowing for missing value estimation, statistical data type and likelihood discovery, anomaly detection and dependency structure mining, on top of providing accurate density estimation.},

Deep probabilistic programming languages (PPL) are a powerful tool to ease the development of probabilistic models. They let users specify generative probabilistic models as programs and then ``compile'' those models down into inference procedures. Since probabilistic inference is still intractable, existing deep PPLs leverage deep learning for inference. The key idea is to describe inference via a second model called an inference model trained in variational fashion. Both the generative and the inference models can include deep neural networks as components. While the details of the employed neural architectures may differ, they typically model distributions only implicitly, i.e., they allow for sampling but not the computation of marginal probabilities. This extended abstract makes the case to not "go down the full neural road", but to explicitly obtain uncertainties in an arithmetic circuit manner. To this end, sum-product networks (SPNs) are a promising option, as they are a class of probabilistic model which permit explicit uncertainties and efficient inference. More precisely, SPNs can compute any marginalization and conditioning query in time linear of the model's representation size. Although SPNs can be described in a nutshell as "deep mixture models", they have received no attention in the deep PPL community, despite their attractive inference properties.},

However, systematic tools to evaluate "sensationalism" and similar aspects concerning the wording in pieces of science communication are still missing. Furthermore, comparisons between European countries are difficult, as systematic access (e.g., to scientific press releases) differs from one country to another. Our interdisciplinary group will present approaches to compare press releases from different disciplines, institutions and countries by means of database examples from Germany (providing an already analysed database extracted from the “Informationsdienst Wissenschaft” of more than 300 000 press releases from about 1000 institutions) and France (using a newly constructed corpus from more than 100 institutions). Considering different perspectives from communication science, informatics and statistics we discuss to what extent indexes based on a set of "sensational words" and other forms of linguistic analysis may deliver hints for unethical exaggerations in different fields of science communication.},

		The advent of industry 4.0 and the availability of large data storage systems lead to an increasing demand for specially educated data-oriented professionals in industrial production. The education of such specialists is supposed to combine elements from the three fields of engineering, data analysis and data administration. Data administration skills are demanded to handle big data in diverse storage structures in data bases. In order to extract knowledge from the stored data the proficient handling of data analysis tools - especially machine learning - is essential. Finally, industrial domain knowledge is important to identify possible applications for machine learning algorithms (and to interpret the results). However, to the best knowledge of the authors, an education program incorporating elements of all three fields has not yet been established (in Germany).

		In the context of the newly acquired project "Industrial Data Science" (InDaS) we aim to develop a qualification concept for machine learning in industrial production targeted at two different groups. On the one hand advanced students from any of the three fields mentioned above and on the other hand experienced professionals working in industrial production. For the first group a one term lecture is going to be designed while coping with different levels of knowledge in the inhomogeneous audience. It will be followed by a seminar with focus on use cases delivered by partners from industrial production. Separately a workshop concept for the second target group will be developed taking into account the strong domain knowledge of the participants.

		The contents of the qualification concept should be selected according to the needs of industrial companies. Therefore a survey was created to inquire the use and potentials of machine learning and the requirements for future employees in industrial production. The evaluation of the survey and the resulting conclusions affecting the qualification concept are going to be presented in this talk.

Problems ranging over probabilistic inference, planning, game theory, and numerical optimization have been tackled successfully using WMC technology. Weighted model integration (WMI) is a recent formalism generalizing WMC to the integration of functions over models of mixed discrete-continuous theories. WMI has already shown tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic programs. Yet, state of the art tools for WMI are nowhere as versatile as those for WMC--solvers are generally limited either by the range of amenable theories, or in terms of performance. Moreover, the data structures to represent, compose, and transform formulas over mixed theories have not reached the efficiency of their Boolean counterparts. Arguably, the latter is one of the prime reasons why WMC is so widely applicable. To address both limitations, we propose the use of extended algebraic decision diagrams (XADDs) as a compilation language for WMI. Aside from tackling typical WMI problems XADDs also enable partial WMI yielding parametrized solutions. To overcome the main roadblock of XADDs---the computational cost of variable elimination---we formulate a novel and powerful exact symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm that unlike its predecessor is able to effectively cache partial computations and seamlessly handle Boolean, integer-valued, and real variables. Our empirical results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can lead to an exponential to linear computational reduction in the best case and that it exceeds or matches state-of-the-art WMI solvers in terms of performance.},

We propose a probabilistic logic approach for robot grasping, which improves grasping capabilities by leveraging semantic object parts. It provides the robot with semantic reasoning skills about the most likely object part to be grasped, given the task constraints and object properties, while also dealing with the uncertainty of visual perception and grasp planning. The probabilistic logic framework is task-dependent. It semantically reasons about pre-grasp configurations with respect to the intended task and employs object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent grasping points. The logic-based module receives data from a low-level module that extracts semantic objects parts, and sends information to the low-level grasp planner. These three modules define our probabilistic logic framework, which is able to perform robotic grasping in realistic kitchen-related scenarios.},

We propose the use of probabilistic context-free grammars to sequence a series of primitives to generate complex robot policies from a given library of primitives. The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However, the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the posteriors of the grammars given the observations. Restrictions over operators connecting the search define the corresponding proposal distributions and, therefore, guide the optimization additionally. In experiments, we validate our method on a redundant 7 degree-of-freedom lightweight robotic arm on tasks that require the generation of complex sequences of motions out of simple primitives.},

This relieves the user from deciding a-priori the parametric form of the random variables but is still expressive enough to effectively approximate any continuous distribution and permits efficient learning and inference.

Specifically, we prove that Gaussian DNs admit coresets of size independent of the size of the data set. Unfortunately, this does not extend to DNs over members of the exponential family in general. As we will prove, Poisson DNs do not admit small coresets. Despite this worst-case result, we will provide an argument why our coreset construction for DNs can still work well in practice on count data. To corroborate our theoretical results, we empirically evaluated the resulting Core DNs on real data sets. The results demonstrate significant gains over no or naive sub-sampling, even in the case of count data.},

HSI acquires the spectral reflectance of an object, depending on its biochemical and structural characteristics. For analysing the complex hyperspectral data, an efficient unsupervised approach for clustering massive hyperspectral data was designed, based on efficient hierarchical decomposition of spectral information according to archetypal data points.

On the other hand, kernels that do take global graph properties into account may not scale well to large graph databases. Here we propose to start exploring the space between local and global graph kernels, striking the balance between both worlds. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph kernel based on the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, and show that it takes local as well as global properties into account. Unfortunately, the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm scales exponentially in k. Consequently, we devise a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation guarantees using conditional Rademacher averages. On bounded degree graphs, it can even be computed in constant time. We support our theoretical results with experiments on several graph classification benchmarks, showing that our kernels often outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracies.},

Optical sensors are advanced techniques for phenotyping host-pathogen interactions on different scales and for detecting subtle plant resistance responses against pathogens. A microscope with a hyperspectral camera was used to study interactions between Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei and barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes with high susceptibility or resistance due to hypersensitive response (HR) and papilla formation. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of pathogen development was used to explain changes in hyperspectral signatures. Within 48 hours after inoculation, genotype specific changes in the green and red range (500-690 nm) and a blue shift of the red edge inflection point were observed. Manual analysis indicated resistance-specific reflectance patterns from one to three days after inoculation. These changes could be linked to host plant modifications depending on individual host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Retrospective analysis of hyperspectral images revealed spectral characteristics of HR against B. graminis f. sp. hordei. For early HR detection, an advanced data mining approach localized HR spots before they became visible on the RGB images derived from hyperspectral imaging. The link among processes during pathogenesis and host resistance to changes in hyperspectral signatures, provide evidence that sensor based phenotyping is suitable to advance time-consuming and cost-expensive visual rating of plant disease resistances.},

More concretely, we consider the following two-step classification approach. In the first step, rule learning algorithms are used to extract frequent patterns and rules from a given data set. The output of this step comprises a huge number of rules (given fairly low confidence and support parameters) and these cannot directly be used for the purpose of classification as they are usually inconsistent with one another. Therefore, in the second step, we interpret these rules as the input for approaches to structured argumentation. Using the argumentative inference procedures of these approaches and given a new observation, the classification of the new observation is determined by constructing arguments on top of these rules for the different classes and determining their justification status.},

Unfortunately, specifying such problems in complex domains involving relations, objects and other logical dependencies is cumbersome at best, requiring considerable expert knowledge, and solvers require models to be painstakingly reduced to standard forms. To overcome this, we introduce a rich modeling framework for optimization problems that allows convenient codification of symbolic structure. Rather than reducing this symbolic structure to a sparse or dense matrix, we represent and exploit it directly using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Combining efficient ADD-based matrix-vector algebra with a matrix-free interior-point method, we develop an engine that can fully leverage the structure of symbolic representations to solve convex linear and quadratic optimization problems. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.},

The idea is to iteratively turn continuous attributes into discrete labels using randomized hash functions. We illustrate hash graph kernels for the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and for the shortest-path kernel. The resulting novel graph kernels are shown to be, both, able to handle graphs with continuous attributes and scalable to large graphs and data sets.

The temporal and spatial development of CLS lesions on the two genotypes were monitored using a hyperspectral microscope. The lesion development on the QTL-carrying, resistant genotype was characterised by a fast and abrupt change in spectral reflectance, whereas it was slower and ultimately more severe on the genotype lacking the QTL.

Many successful approaches alleviate this problem by employing some form of distant supervision, i.e., look into knowledge bases such as Freebase as a source of supervision to create more examples. While this is perfectly reasonable, most distant supervision methods rely on a hand-coded background knowledge that explicitly looks for patterns in text. For example, they assume all sentences containing Person X and Person Y are positive examples of the relation married(X, Y). In this work, we take a different approach -- we infer weakly supervised examples for relations from models learned by using knowledge outside the natural language task. We argue that this method creates more robust examples that are particularly useful when learning the entire information-extraction model (the structure and parameters). We demonstrate on three domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to using distant supervision labels or a smaller set of gold-standard labels.},

Yet, notwithstanding growing scholarly interest, the suitability of the viral metaphor seems not to have been studied so far. In this paper, we therefore investigate the attention dynamics of viral videos from the point of view of mathematical epidemiology. We introduce a novel probabilistic model of the progression of infective diseases and use it to analyze time series of YouTube view counts and Google searches. Our results on a data set of almost 800 videos show that their attention dynamics are indeed well accounted for by our epidemic model. In particular, we find that the vast majority of videos considered in this study show very high infection rates.},

With the exception of TRW for marginal inference, however, this framework resulted in approximate MAP algorithms only, based on equitable and orbit partitions of the graphical model. Here, we deepen our understanding of it for marginal inference. We show that a large class of concave free energies admits equitable partitions, of which orbit partitions are a special case, that can be exploited for lifting. Although already interesting on its own, we go one step further. We demonstrate that concave free energies of pairwise models can be reparametrized so that existing convergent algorithms for lifted marginal inference can be used without modification.},

We overcome these limitations by building our own, transnational, large-scale dataset inferred from publicly available information on the Web. Essentially, we developed Compressed Label Propagation (CLP) to infer missing geo-tags of author-paper-pairs retrieved from online bibliographies tkaing symmetries of the network into account for speed up of LP. On this dataset, we then find statistical regularities that explain how researchers in CS move from one place to another.},

Both models are presented within a decision and regression tree framework for building rules that are actionable by companies.

The results show that PDNs enable a significantly better short-term prediction in comparison to a prediction based on the physics of traffic. To combine vehicular traffic with cellular communication networks, a correlation between connectivity indicators and vehicular traffic flow is shown based on measurement results.

A relational linear program (RLP) is a declarative LP template defining the objective and the constraints through the logical concepts of objects, relations, and quantified variables. This allows one to express the LP objective and constraints relationally for a varying number of individuals and relations among them without enumerating them. Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logical program consisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP. This ground LP is solved using lifted linear programming. That is, symmetries within the ground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the reduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. In contrast to mainstream LP template languages like AMPL, which features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a more intuitive representation of optimization problems over relational domains. We illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in Markov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision processes, and on collective inference using LP support vector machines.},

This has two benefits. First, off-the-shelf propagation schemes can be used to naturally construct kernels for many graph types, including labeled, partially labeled, unlabeled, directed, and attributed graphs. Second, by leveraging existing efficient and informative propagation schemes, propagation kernels can be considerably faster than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing predictive performance. We will also show that if the graphs at hand have a regular structure, for instance when modeling image or video data, one can exploit this regularity to scale the kernel computation to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes.

Specifically, we introduce a new probabilistic logic module to first semantically reason about pre-grasp configurations with respect to the intended tasks. Further, a mapping is learned from part-related visual features to good grasping points. The probabilistic logic module makes use of object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent grasping points.

Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed GPC method using privileged noise, called GPC+, improves over a standard GPC without privileged knowledge, and also over the current state-of-the-art SVM-based method, SVM+.

CSGs classify clusters of variables by projecting relations between cluster members onto a graph, allowing for the efficient pruning of symmetrical clusters even before their generation. Second, we introduce a novel framework based on CSGs for the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear program (LP) relaxations, dedicated to exploiting this symmetry for the benefit of tight Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approximations. Combined with the pruning power of CSG, the framework quickly generates compact formulations for otherwise intractable LPs, as demonstrated by several empirical results.},

Our pipeline consists of three stages---(1) a segmentation layer where brain MRI data is divided into clinically relevant regions; (2) a classification layer that uses relational learning algorithms to make pairwise predictions between the three classes; and (3) a combination layer that combines the results of the different classes to obtain the final classification. One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers.

Instead, we introduce GeoDBLP where we propagate geographical seed locations retrieved from the web across the DBLP database of 1,080,958 authors and 1,894,758 papers. But perhaps more important is that we are able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the migration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not memoryless but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to make k>1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that migration at later career stages is memoryless. This aligns well but actually goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education and research worldwide.},

We consider multi-relational environments such as real-time strategy games and use functional-gradient boosting to capture and transfer the models learned in these environments. Our experiments demonstrate that our learner learns a very good initial model from the simple scenario and effectively transfers the knowledge to the more complex scenario thus achieving a jump start, a steeper learning curve and a higher convergence in performance.},

Today's datasets from longitudinal studies offer great promise to uncover these interactions but also pose enormous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with potential long-range interactions over time. Our investigation demonstrates that a statistical relational analysis of longitudinal data can easily uncover complex interactions of risks factors and actually predict future coronary artery calcification (CAC) levels --- an indicator of the risk of CHD present subclinically in an individual --- significantly better than traditional non-relational approaches. The uncovered long-range interactions between risk factors conform to existing clinical knowledgeand are successful in identifying risk factors at the early adult stage. This may contribute to monitoring young adults via smartphones and to designing patient-specific treatments in young adults to mitigate their risk later.},

The ``response turning time-point'' in the temporal curve of plant response to stress rather than the maxima is the most relevant time-point for guided sampling to get insights into mechanistic basis of plant response to drought stress. Comparative hyperspectral image analysis was performed on barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants grown under well-watered and water stress conditions in two consecutive years. The obtained massive, high-dimensional data cubes were analysed with a recent matrix factorization technique based on simplex volume maximization of hyperspectral data and compared to several drought-related traits.

This exciting new opportunity, however, also raises many challenges. One of them is scaling inference within and training of graphical models. Typical ways to address this scaling issue are inference by approximate message passing, stochastic gradients, and MapReduce, among others. Often, we encounter inference and training problems with symmetries and redundancies in the graph structure. It has been shown that inference and training can indeed benefit from exploiting symmetries, for example by lifting loopy belief propagation (LBP).That is, a model is compressed by grouping nodes together that send and receive identical messages so that a modified LBP running on the lifted graph yields the same marginals as LBP on the original one, but often in a fraction of time. By establishing a link between lifting and radix sort, we show that lifting is MapReduce-able and thus combine the two orthogonal approaches to scaling inference, namely exploiting symmetries and employing parallel computations.},

In this work, we take a different approach -- we create weakly supervised examples for relations by using commonsense knowledge. The key innovation is that this commonsense knowledge is completely independent of the natural language text. This helps when learning the full model for information extraction as against simply learning the parameters of a known CRF or MLN. We demonstrate on two domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to simply using the gold standard labels.},

Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents. Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

Pre-symptomatic water stress detection is of particular interest, ultimately helping to meet the challenge of ``How to feed a hungry world?''. Due to the climate change, this is of considerable political and public interest. Due to its large-scale and temporal nature, e.g., when monitoring plants using hyper-spectral imaging, and the demand of physical meaning of the results, it presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability. However, big data matrices over time also arise in several other real-life applications such as stock market monitoring where a business sector is characterized by the ups and downs of each of its companies per year or topic monitoring of document collections. Therefore, we consider the general problem of embedding data matrices into Euclidean space over time without making any assumption on the generating distribution of each matrix. To do so, we represent all data samples by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time. On the simplex spanned by the extremes, there are then natural candidates for distributions inducing distances between and in turn embeddings of the data matrices. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic, text, and financial data as well as a large-scale dataset on water stress detection in plants with more than 3 billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that the embeddings are meaningful and fast to compute. The stress detection results were validated by a domain expert and conform to existing plant physiological knowledge.

They have been proposed as an alternative to the SVD because they naturally lead to interpretable decompositions which was shown to be successful in application such as fraud detection, fMRI segmentation, and collaborative filtering. The CUR decomposition of large matrices, for example, samples rows and columns according to a probability distribution that depends on the Euclidean norm of rows or columns or on other measures of statistical leverage. At the same time, there are various deterministic approaches that do not resort to sampling and were found to often yield factorization of superior quality with respect to reconstruction accuracy. However, these are hardly applicable to large matrices as they typically suffer from high computational costs. Consequently, many practitioners in the field of data mining have abandon deterministic approaches in favor of randomized ones when dealing with today's large-scale data sets. In this paper, we empirically disprove this prejudice. We do so by introducing a novel, linear-time, deterministic CUR approach that adopts the recently introduced Simplex Volume Maximization approach for column selection. The latter has already been proven to be successful for NMF-like decompositions of matrices of billions of entries. Our exhaustive empirical study on more than 30 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrates that it is also beneficial for CUR-like decompositions. Compared to other deterministic CUR-like methods, it provides comparable reconstruction quality but operates much faster so that it easily scales to matrices of billions of elements. Compared to sampling-based methods, it provides competitive reconstruction quality while staying in the same run-time complexity class.},

DAR represents all data by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time and easy to interpret.Then, it puts a Gaussian process prior on the Dirichlet distributions induced on the simplex spanned by the extremes. The prior can be a function of any observed meta feature such as time, location, type of fertilization, and plant species. We evaluated DAR on two hyperspectral image series of plants over time with about 2 (resp. 5.8) Billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that DAR can be learned efficiently and predicts stress well before it becomes visible to the human eye.},

However, previously proposed kernels rely on having discrete node label information. In this paper, we explore the power of continuous node-level features for propagation-based graph kernels. Specifically, propagation kernels exploit node label distributions from propagation schemes like label propagation, which naturally enables the construction of graph kernels for partially labeled graphs. In order to effciently extract graph features from continuous node label distributions, and in general from continuous vector-valued node attributes, we utilize randomized techniques, which easily allow for deriving similarity measures based on propagated information. We show that propagation kernels utilizing locality-sensitive hashing reduce the runtime of existing graph kernels by several orders of magnitude. We evaluate the performance of various propagation kernels on real-world bioinformatics and image benchmark datasets.},

When applied to game telemetry data, pattern recognition and statistical analysis provide valuable business intelligence tools for game development. An important problem in this area is to characterize how player engagement in a game evolves over time. Reliable models are of pivotal interest since they allow for assessing the long-term success of game products and can provide estimates of how long players may be expected to keep actively playing a game. In this paper, we introduce methods from random process theory into game data mining in order to draw inferences about player engagement. Given large samples (over 250,000 players) of behavioral telemetry data from five different action-adventure and shooter games, we extract information as to how long individual players have played these games and apply techniques from lifetime analysis to identify common patterns. In all five cases, we find that the Weibull distribution gives a good account of the statistics of total playing times. This implies that an average player's interest in playing one of the games considered evolves according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Therefore, given data on the initial playtime behavior of the players of a game, it becomes possible to predict when they stop playing.},

A prominent example are probabilistic logical models that tackle a long standing goal of AI, namely unifying first-order logic --- capturing regularities and symmetries --- and probability --- capturing uncertainty. Although they often encode large, complex models using few rules only and, hence, symmetries and redundancies abound, inference in them was originally still at the propositional representation level and did not exploit symmetries. This paper is intended to give a (not necessarily complete) overview and invitation to the emerging field of lifted probabilistic inference, inference techniques that exploit these symmetries in graphical models in order to speed up inference, ultimately orders of magnitude.},

Our key insight is that while there may be an infinite number of observations, there are only a finite number of continuous observation partitionings that are relevant for optimal decision-making when a finite, fixed set of reachable belief states is considered. To this end, we make two important contributions: (1) we show how previous exact symbolic dynamic programming solutions for continuous state MDPs can be generalized to continuous state POMDPs with discrete observations, and (2) we show how recently developed symbolic integration methods allow this solution to be extended to PBVI for continuous state and observation POMDPs with potentially correlated, multivariate continuous observation spaces.},

Our pipeline consists of three stages -- (1) a segmentation layer where brain MRI data is divided into clinically relevant regions; (2) a classification layer that uses relational learning algorithms to make pairwise predictions between the three classes; and (3) a combination layer that combines the results of the different classes to obtain the final classification. One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers.

For proportional data (normalized histograms), this is not the case. Due to the sum-to-unity constraint, features that are as independent as possible will not all be uncorrelated. In this paper, we show that a linear-time transformation efficiently copes with sum-to-unity constraints: first, we select a small number K of diverse data points by maximizing the volume of the simplex spanned by these prototypes; second, we represent each data point by means of its cosine similarities to the K selected prototypes. This maximum volume hashing is sensible since each dimension in the transformed space is likely to follow a von Mises (vM) distribution, and, in very high dimensions, the vM distribution closely resembles a Gaussian distribution. This justifies to employ PCA on the transformed data. Our extensive experiments validate this: maximum volume hashing outperforms spectral hashing and other state of the art techniques.},

Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents. Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

It is an unsupervised classification approach, optimised for fast computation of massive datasets. It allows calculation of how similar each spectrum is to observed typical spectra. This provides the means to express how likely it is that one plant is suffering from stress. The method was tested for drought stress, applied to potted barley plants in a controlled rain-out shelter experiment and to agricultural corn plots subjected to a two factorial field setup altering water and nutrient availability. Both experiments were conducted on the canopy level. SiVM was significantly better than using a combination of established vegetation indices.

We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E3 and R-MAX algorithms. Efficient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efficiency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efficient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.},

It has experienced an incredible evolution in the recent decade, especially since the Human Genome project. Although, a very first link between both fields has been established already in the early 90ies, many recent papers on mobility mining seem to be unaware of it. We therefore revisit the link and show that many unexplored and novel mobility mining methods fall naturally out of it. Specifically, using advanced discretization techniques for stay-point detection and map matching, we turn traffic sequences into a biological ones. Then, we introduce a novel distance function that enables us to directly apply the rich toolbox for biological sequence analysis to it. For instance, by just looking at co mplex traffic data through the biological glasses of sequence logos we get a novel, easy-to-grasp visualization of data, called Traffic Logos. For clustering and prediction tasks, our empirical evaluation on three real-world data sets demonstrates that revisiting the link can yield performance as good as state-of-the-art data mining techniques.},

Then, we find paths of atoms that are connected via their arguments, variablize the ground atoms in each path, in order to create features for the query. These features are used to re-personalize the original RWR and to finally compute the set completion, based on Label Propagation. Moreover, we exploit that RWR techniques can naturally be lifted and show that lifted inference for label propagation is possible.

A popular solution in these cases is the idea of turning the complex inference task into a sequence of simpler ones by selecting and clamping variables one at a time and running lifted message passing again after each selection. This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference. We show how to avoid this by efficiently computing the lifted network for each conditioning directly from the one already known for the single node marginals.

We consider imitation learning in relational domains, in which there is a varying number of objects and relations among them. In prior work, simple relational policies are learned by viewing imitation learning as supervised learning of a function from states to actions. For propositional worlds, functional gradient methods have been proved to be beneficial. They are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient, more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the form of the function. Building on recent generalizations of functional gradient boosting to relational representations, we implement a functional gradient boosting approach to imitation learning in relational domains. In particular, given a set of traces from the human teacher, our system learns a policy in the form of a set of relational regression trees that additively approximate the functional gradients. The use of multiple additive trees combined with relational representation allows for learning more expressive policies than what has been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in several different domains.},

As we will show, inference and learning within the resulting class of models, called relational multi-task Gaussian processes, can be realized via a variational EM algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the usefulness of this approach: The observed relational knowledge at the level of tasks can indeed reveal additional pair wise correlations between tasks of interest and, in turn, improve prediction performance.},

Learning MLNs is a hard problem and therefore has attracted much interest in the SRL community. Current methods for learning MLNs follow a twostep approach: first, perform a search through the space of possible clauses and then learn appropriate weights for these clauses. We propose to take a different approach, namely to learn both the weights and the structure of the MLN simultaneously. Our approach is based on functional gradient boosting where the problem of learning MLNs is turned into a series of relational functional approximation problems. We use two kinds of representations for the gradients: clausebased and tree-based. Our experimental evaluation on several benchmark data sets demonstrates that our new approach can learn MLNs as good or better than those found with state-ofthe-art methods, but often in a fraction of the time.},

	note         = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

Previous work has developed a set of operations for composition and for removing redundancies in FODDs, thus keeping them compact, and showed how to successfully employ FODDs for solving large-scale stochastic planning problems through the formalism of relational Markov decision processes (RMDP). In this paper, we introduce several new ideas enhancing the applicability of FODDs. More specifically, we first introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and composition operations for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we develop a novel approach for reducing (G)FODDs using model checking. This yields -- for the first time -- a reduction that maximally reduces the diagram for the FODD case and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs. Finally we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a complete solution for the case where the reward function is specified using an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers.},

In this work, we show that it is also possible to exploit the full expressive power of first-order quantification to achieve state, action, and observation abstraction in a dynamic programming solution to relationally specified POMDPs. Among the advantages of this approach are the ability to maintain compact value function representations, abstract over the space of potentially optimal actions, and automatically derive compact conditional policy trees that minimally partition relational observation spaces according to distinctions that have an impact on policy values. This is the first lifted relational POMDP solution that can optimally accommodate actions with a potentially infinite relational space of observation outcomes.},

We demonstrate this idea by introducing novel model-checking reduction operations for First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a representation that has been used to implement decision-theoretic planning with Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP). Intuitively, these reductions modify the construction of the value function by removing any complex specifications that are irrelevant to the set of training examples, thereby focusing on the region of interest. We show that such training examples can be constructed on the fly from a description of the planning problem thus we can bootstrap to get a self-taught planning system. Additionally, we provide a new heuristic to embed universal and conjunctive goals within the framework of RMDP planners, expanding the scope and applicability of such systems. We show that these ideas lead to significant improvements in performance in terms of both speed and coverage of the planner, yielding state of the art planning performance on problems from the International Planning Competition.},

Many existing image search engines, however, present users with sets of images arranged in some default order on the screen, typically the relevance to a query, only. While this certainly has its advantages, arguably, a more flexible and intuitive way would be to sort images into arbitrary structures such as grids, hierarchies, or spheres so that images that are visually or semantically alike are placed together. This paper focuses on designing such a navigation system for image browsers. This is a challenging task because arbitrary layout structure makes it difficult -- if not impossible -- to compute cross-similarities between images and structure coordinates, the main ingredient of traditional layouting approaches. For this reason, we resort to a recently developed machine learning technique: kernelized sorting. It is a general technique for matching pairs of objects from different domains without requiring cross-domain similarity measures and hence elegantly allows sorting images into arbitrary structures. Moreover, we extend it so that some images can be preselected for instance forming the tip of the hierarchy allowing to subsequently navigate through the search results in the lower levels in an intuitive way.},

While it was already shown that active learning can effectively reduce the number of training pairs needed, the most successful existing algorithms cannot generalize over items or queries. Considering web search as an example, they would need to learn a separate relevance score for each document-query pair from scratch. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose a link-based active preference learning method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) that incorporates dependency information from both feature-vector representations as well as relations. Specifically, to meet the requirement on computational efficiency of active exploration, we introduce a novel incremental update method that scales as well as the non-generalizing models. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on datasets for information retrieval, showing that it learns substantially faster than algorithms that cannot model dependencies.},

This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference. We show how to avoid this by efficiently computing the lifted network for each conditioning directly from the one already known for the single node marginals.

In this paper, we advocate to view this task as a problem of fast, large-scale retrieval. Intuitively, given a dataset of millions of labeled scan points and their neighborhoods, we simply search for similar points in the datasets and use the labels of the retrieved ones to predict the labels of a novel point using some local prediction model such as majority vote or logistic regression. However, actually carrying this out requires highly efficient ways of (1) storing millions of scan points in memory and (2) quickly finding similar scan points to a target scan point. In this paper, we propose to address both issues by employing Weiss et al.'s recent spectral hashing. It represents each item in a database by a compact binary code that is constructed so that similar items will have similar binary code words. In turn, similar neighbors have codes within a small Hamming distance of the code for the query. Then, we learn a logistic regression model locally over all points with the same binary code word. Our experiments on real world 3D scans show that the resulting approach, called spectrally hashed logistic regression, can be ultra fast at prediction time and outperforms state-of-the art approaches such as logistic regression and nearest neighbor.},

Surprisingly, kernel methods have not received attention yet although they are very popular in the machine learning community due to their solid mathematical foundation, tendency toward easy geometric interpretation, and strong empirical performance in a wide variety of domains. In this paper, we show how to employ kernels for map matching. Specifically, ignoring map constraints, we first maximize the consistency between the similarity measures captured by the kernel matrices of the trajectory and relevant part of the street map. The resulting relaxed assignment is then ''rounded'' into a hard assignment fulfilling the map constraints. On synthetic and real-world trajectories, we show that kernels methods can be used for map matching and perform well compared to probabilistic methods such as HMMs.},

Recently, lifted belief propagation (LBP) has been proposed as an efficient approximate solution of this inference problem. It runs a modified BP on a lifted network where nodes have been grouped together if they have --- roughly speaking --- identical computation trees, the tree-structured unrolling of the underlying graph rooted at the nodes. In many situations, this purely syntactic criterion is too pessimistic: message errors decay along paths. Intuitively, for a long chain graph with weak edge potentials, distant nodes will send and receive identical messages yet their computation trees are quite different. To overcome this, we propose iLBP, a novel, easy-to-implement, informed LBP approach that interleaves lifting and modified BP iterations. In turn, we can efficiently monitor the true BP messages sent and received in each iteration and group nodes accordingly. As our experiments show, iLBP can yield significantly faster more lifted network while not degrading performance. Above all, we show that iLBP is faster than BP when solving the problem of distributing data to a large network, an important real-world application where BP is faster than uninformed LBP.},

To reduce the risk of a ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), lung protective ventilation is essential, especially for patients with a previous medical history like the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The prerequisite for lung protective ventilation approaches is the knowledge about the physical behavior of the human lung under the condition of mechanical ventilation. This knowledge is commonly described by mathematical models. Diverse models have been introduced to represent particular aspects of mechanical characteristics of the lung. A commonly accepted general model is the equation of motion, which relates the airway pressure to the airflow and the volume applied by the ventilator and describes the influence of the distensibility and resistance of the respiratory system. Equation Discovery systems extract mathematical models from observed time series data. To reduce the vast search space associated with this task, the LAGRAMGE-system introduced the application of declarative bias in Equation Discovery, which furthermore allows the presentation of domain specific knowledge. We introduce a modification of this system and apply it to data obtained during mechanical ventilation of ARDS-patients. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that the equation of motion model can automatically be rediscovered from real-world data.},

	note         = {Matrix factorization methods are among the most common techniques for detecting latent components in data. Popular examples include the Singular Value Decomposition or Non-negative Matrix Factorization. Unfortunately, most methods suffer from high computational complexity and therefore do not scale to massive data. In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for the factorization of gigantic matrices that iteratively yields latent components. We consider a constrained matrix factorization s.t.~the latent components form a simplex that encloses most of the remaining data. The algorithm maximizes the volume of that simplex and thereby reduces the displacement of data from the space spanned by the latent components. Hence, it also lowers the Frobenius norm, a common criterion for matrix factorization quality. Our algorithm is efficient, well-grounded in distance geometry, and easily applicable to matrices with billions of entries. In addition, the resulting factors allow for an intuitive interpretation of data: every data point can now be expressed as a convex combination of the most extreme and thereby often most descriptive instances in a collection of data. Extensive experimental validations on web-scale data, including 80 million images and 1.5 million twitter tweets, demonstrate superior performance compared to related factorization or clustering techniques.},

Infinite hidden relational models (IHRMs) introduce nonparametric mixture models into relational learning and have been successful in many relational applications. In this paper we explore the modeling and analysis of complex social networks with IHRMs for community detection, link prediction and product recommendation. In an IHRM-based social network model, each edge is associated with a random variable and the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables are specified by the model, based on the relational structure. The hidden variables, one for each object, are able to transport information such that non-local probabilistic dependencies can be obtained. The model can be used to predict entity attributes, to predict relationships between entities and it performs an interpretable cluster analysis. We demonstrate the performance of IHRMs with three social network applications. We perform community analysis on the Sampson's monastery data and perform link analysis on the Bernard & Killworth data. Finally we apply IHRMs to the MovieLens data for prediction of user preference on movies and for an analysis of user clusters and movie clusters.},

In this paper, we present a new and simple BP algorithm, called counting BP, that exploits such additional symmetries. Starting from a given factor graph, counting BP first constructs a compressed factor graph of clusternodes and clusterfactors, corresponding to sets of nodes and factors that are indistinguishable given the evidence. Then it runs a modified BP algorithm on the compressed graph that is equivalent to running BP on the original factor graph. Our experiments show that counting BP is applicable to a variety of important AI tasks such as (dynamic) relational models and boolean model counting, and that significant efficiency gains are obtainable, often by orders of magnitude.},

Previous work developed a set of operations over FODDs, showed how they can be used to solve relational Markov decision processes (RMDP) using dynamic programming algorithms, and demonstrated their success in solving stochastic planning problems from the International Planning Competition in the system FODD-Planner. A crucial ingredient of this scheme is a set of operations to remove redundancy in decision diagrams, thus keeping them compact. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and combination algorithms for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a particularly promising case where an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers is followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers. Third, we develop a new approach to reduce FODDs and GFODDs using model checking. This yields a reduction that is complete for FODDs and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs.},

	note         = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

	note         = {The task of aligning sequences arises in many applications. Classical dynamic programming approaches require the explicit state enumeration in the reward model. This is often impractical: the number of states grows very quickly with the number of domain objects and relations among these objects. Relational sequence alignment aims at exploiting symbolic structure to avoid the full enumeration. This comes at the expense of a more complex reward model selection problem: virtually infinitely many abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we apply gradientbased boosting to leverage this problem. Specifically, we show how to reduce the learning problem to a series of relational regressions problems. The main benefit of this is that interactions between states variables are introduced only as needed, so that the potentially infinite search space is not explicitly considered. As our experimental results show, this boosting approach can significantly improve upon established results in challenging applications.},

Similarly, there has been previous work such as Logical HMMs on extending HMMs to domains with relational structure. In this work we develop a representation that naturally combines the power of both relational and hierarchical models in the form of Logical Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (LoHiHMMs). LoHiHMMs inherit the compactness of representation from Logical HMMs and the tractability of inference from Hierarchical HMMs. We outline two inference algorithms: one based on grounding the LoHiHMM to a propositional HMM and the other based on particle filtering adapted for this setting.

We present a new lifted inference algorithm, C-FOVE, that not only handles counting formulas in its input, but also creates counting formulas for use in intermediate potentials. C-FOVE can be described succinctly in terms of six operators, along with heuristics for when to apply them.

To this end, we develop a multi-relational Gaussian process (MRGP) model. The MRGP model introduces multiple GPs for each type of entities. Each random variable drawn from a GP represents profile/preference of an entity in some aspect, which is the function value of entity features at the aspect. These GPs are then coupled together via relations between entities. The MRGP model can be used for relation prediction and (semi-) supervised learning. We give an analysis of the MRGP model for bipartite, directed and undirected univariate relations.},

The major benefit of our approach is its ability to generalize over entire range scans directly. This way, we can learn the distributions of range measurements for whole regions of the robot's configuration space from only few recorded or simulated range scans. Especially in approximative approaches to state estimation like particle filtering or histogram filtering, this leads to a better approximation of the true likelihood function. Experiments on real world and synthetic data show that Gaussian beam processes combine the advantages of two popular measurement models.},

In this paper, we propose to apply techniques from statistical relational learning to the pathplanning problem. More precisely, we propose to learn relational decision trees as abstract navigation strategies from example paths. Relational abstraction has several interesting and important properties. First, it allows a mobile robot to imitate navigation behavior shown by users or by optimal policies. Second, it yields comprehensible models of behavior. Finally, a navigation policy learned in one environment naturally transfers to unknown environments. In several experiments with real robots and in simulated runs, we demonstrate that our approach yields efficient navigation plans. We show that our system is robust against observation noise and can outperform hand-crafted policies.},

SCGEM avoids the line search by adopting the scaling mechanism of SCGs applied to the expected information matrix. This guarantees a single likelihood evaluation per iteration. We empirically compare SCGEM with EM and conventional conjugate gradient accelerated EM. The experiments show that SCGEM can significantly accelerate both of them and is equal in quality.},

In the study, we compared different methods of measuring pressure--volume curves in artificially ventilated patients suffering from the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our aim was to show that inductive machine learning can be used to gain insights into differences and similarities among these methods. We defined two tasks: the first one was to recognize the measurement method producing a given pressure--volume curve. This was defined as the task of classifying pressure--volume curves (the classes being the measurement methods). The second was to model the curves themselves, that is, to predict the volume given the pressure, the measurement method and the patient data. Clearly, this can be defined as a regression task. For these two tasks, we applied C5.0 and CUBIST, two inductive machine learning tools, respectively. Apart from medical findings regarding the characteristics of the measurement methods, we found some evidence showing the value of an abstract representation for classifying curves: normalization and high-level descriptors from curve fitting played a crucial role in obtaining reasonably accurate models. Another useful feature of algorithms for inductive machine learning is the possibility of incorporating background knowledge. In our study, the incorporation of patient data helped to improve regression results dramatically, which might open the door for the individual respiratory treatment of patients in the future.},

	Note = {Diffusion models (DMs) produce very detailed and high-quality images. Their power results from extensive training on large amounts of data, usually scraped from the internet without proper attribution or consent from content creators. Unfortunately, this practice raises privacy and intellectual property concerns, as DMs can memorize and later reproduce their potentially sensitive or copyrighted training images at inference time. Prior efforts prevent this issue by either changing the input to the diffusion process, thereby preventing the DM from generating memorized samples during inference, or removing the memorized data from training altogether. While those are viable solutions when the DM is developed and deployed in a secure and constantly monitored environment, they hold the risk of adversaries circumventing the safeguards and are not effective when the DM itself is publicly released. To solve the problem, we introduce NeMo, the first method to localize memorization of individual data samples down to the level of neurons in DMs' cross-attention layers. Through our experiments, we make the intriguing finding that in many cases, single neurons are responsible for memorizing particular training samples. By deactivating these memorization neurons, we can avoid the replication of training data at inference time, increase the diversity in the generated outputs, and mitigate the leakage of private and copyrighted data. In this way, our NeMo contributes to a more responsible deployment of DMs.},

However, these methods add friction to the interactive process, rigidly requiring to fully specify the expert input as prior distribution ex ante and often imposing additional constraints on the optimization framework. This hinders the flexible incorporation of expertise and valuable knowledge of domain experts, which might provide partial feedback at any time during optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel Bayesian optimization approach leveraging tractable probabilistic models named probabilistic circuits (PCs) as surrogate model. PCs encode a tractable joint distribution over the hybrid hyperparameter space and enable exact conditional inference and sampling, allowing users to provide valuable insights interactively and generate configurations adhering to their feedback. We demonstrate the benefits of the resulting interactive HPO through an extensive empirical evaluation of diverse benchmarks, including the challenging setting of neural architecture search.},

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at computeoptimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.},

Specifically, they allow users to perform interventional interactions on these concepts by updating the concept values and thus correcting the predictive output of the model. Traditionally, however, these interventions are applied to the model only once and discarded afterward. To rectify this, we present concept bottleneck memory models (CB2M), an extension to CBMs. Specifically, a CB2M learns to generalize interventions to appropriate novel situations via a two-fold memory with which it can learn to detect mistakes and to reapply previous interventions. In this way, a CB2M learns to automatically improve model performance from a few initially obtained interventions. If no prior human interventions are available, a CB2M can detect potential mistakes of the CBM bottleneck and request targeted interventions. In our experimental evaluations on challenging scenarios like handling distribution shifts and confounded training data, we illustrate that CB2M are able to successfully generalize interventions to unseen data and can indeed identify wrongly inferred concepts. Overall, our results show that CB2M is a great tool for users to provide interactive feedback on CBMs, e.g., by guiding a user's interaction and requiring fewer interventions.},

Inspired by residual networks, we derive a condition under which rational units are closed under residual connections and formulate a naturally regularised version. The proposed joint-rational activation allows for desirable degrees of flexibility, yet regularises plasticity to an extent that avoids overfitting by leveraging a mutual set of activation function parameters across layers. We demonstrate that equipping popular algorithms with (joint) rational activations leads to consistent improvements on different games from the Atari Learning Environment benchmark, notably making DQN competitive to DDQN and Rainbow.},

Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters MIAs, thereby increasing a model's privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, beating state-of-the-art defenses. This establishes a practical and powerful novel way for enhancing model resilience against MIAs.},

Many prominent DAG learners rely on least square losses or log-likelihood losses for optimization. It is well-known from regression models that least square losses are heavily influenced by the scale of the variables. Recently it has been demonstrated that the scale of data also affects performance of structure learning algorithms, though with a strong focus on linear 2-node systems and simulated data. Moving beyond these results, we provide conditions under which square-based losses are minimal for wrong DAGs in -dimensional cases. Furthermore, we also show that scale can impair performance of structure learners if relations among variables are non-linear for both square based and log-likelihood based losses.

This is achieved by retrieving object representations from images and synthesizing relational concepts as λ-calculus programs. We evaluate the diverse properties of Pix2Code on the challenging reasoning domains, Kandinsky Patterns and CURI, thereby testing its ability to identify compositional visual concepts that generalize to novel data and concept configurations. Particularly, in stark contrast to neural approaches, we show that Pix2Code’s representations remain human interpretable and can be easily revised for improved performance.},

A neural network is used to estimate the parameters of the learned iSPN using the intervened data. Our experiments on 3 synthetic heterogeneous datasets suggest that SPN can effectively capture the interventional distributions for both discrete and continuous variables while being expressive and causally adequate.

The field of continual learning addresses this separate challenge and first steps have recently been taken to leverage synergies in distributed settings of a purely supervised nature. Motivated by these prior works, we posit that such federated continual learning should be grounded in unsupervised learning of representations that are shared across clients; in the loose spirit of how humans can indirectly leverage others' experience without exposure to a specific task. For this purpose, we demonstrate that masked autoencoders for distribution estimation are particularly amenable to this setup. Specifically, their masking strategy can be seamlessly integrated with task attention mechanisms to enable selective knowledge transfer between clients.

We can further improve the robustness of such explanations by measuring their likelihood within a mutually agreed-upon causal model. For this, typically one of in-principle two distinct types of counterfactual explanations is used: interventional counterfactuals, which treat changes as deliberate interventions to the causal system, and backtracking counterfactuals, which attribute changes exclusively to exogenous factors. Although both frameworks share the common goal of inferring true causal factors, they fundamentally differ in their conception of counterfactuals.

Moreover, the unsupervised nature of this task makes it necessary for human users to be able to understand a model’s learnt concepts and potentially revise false behaviours. To tackle both the generalizability and interpretability constraints of visual concept learning, we propose Pix2Code, a framework that extends program synthesis to visual relational reasoning by utilizing the abilities of both explicit, compositional symbolic and implicit neural representations. This is achieved by retrieving object representations from images and synthesizing relational concepts as λ-calculus programs. We evaluate the diverse properties of Pix2Code on the challenging reasoning domains, Kandinsky Patterns and CURI, thereby testing its ability to identify compositional visual concepts that generalize to novel data and concept configurations. Particularly, in stark contrast to neural approaches, we show that Pix2Code’s representations remain human interpretable and can be easily revised for improved performance.},

Aurora-M is rigorously evaluated across various tasks and languages, demonstrating robustness against catastrophic forgetting and outperforming alternatives in multilingual settings, particularly in safety evaluations.

To this end, we introduce *Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents* (SCoBots), that integrate consecutive concept bottleneck (CB) layers.

Our experimental results provide evidence of SCoBots' competitive performances, but also of their potential for domain experts to understand and regularize their behavior. Among other things, SCoBots enabled us to identify a previously unknown misalignment problem in the iconic video game, Pong, and resolve it.

DTMs focus on token divergence, that allow deeper insights into the subtleties of model compression, in particular when evaluating components' impacts individually. Utilizing the First Divergent Token Metric (FDTM) in model sparsification reveals that 25% of all attention components can be pruned beyond 90% on the Llama-2 model family, still keeping SOTA performance. For quantization FDTM suggests that over 80% of parameters can naively be transformed to int8 without special outlier management. These evaluations indicate the necessity of choosing appropriate compressions for parameters individually---and that FDTM can identify those---while standard metrics result in deteriorated outcomes.},

In response to these challenges, we introduce CollaFuse, a novel framework inspired by split learning. Tailored for efficient and collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context, CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare research, or autonomous driving.

Our empirical research shows a substantial improvement in playing strength, surpassing the traditional single-model framework.

More specifically, we investigate whether LLMs are inherently able to craft adversarial examples out of benign samples to fool existing safe rails. Our experiments, which focus on hate speech detection, reveal that LLMs succeed in finding adversarial perturbations, effectively undermining hate speech detection systems.

We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in the textual description, common models reflect cultural biases in their generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identify a model's text encoder as the root cause of the phenomenon. Such behavior can be interpreted as a model feature, offering users a simple way to customize the image generation and reflect their own cultural background. Yet, malicious users or service providers may also try to intentionally bias the image generation.

This segregation preserves the utility of visit counts for both exploration-exploitation balancing and quality metrics within MCTS. The resultant augmentation facilitates in a considerably broader search using identical computational resources, preserving the essential characteristics of MCTS. The expanded coverage not only yields more precise estimations but also proves instrumental in larger and more complex problems.

Yet, as we will show, multilingual models suffer similarly from (gender) biases as monolingual models. Furthermore, the natural expectation is that these models will provide similar results across languages, but this is not the case and there are important differences between languages. Thus, we propose a novel benchmark MAGBIG intending to foster research in multilingual models without gender bias. We investigate whether multilingual T2I models magnify gender bias with MAGBIG. To this end, we use multilingual prompts requesting portrait images of persons of a certain occupation or trait (using adjectives). Our results show not only that models deviate from the normative assumption that each gender should be equally likely to be generated, but that there are also big differences across languages. Furthermore, we investigate prompt engineering strategies, i.e. the use of indirect, neutral formulations, as a possible remedy for these biases. Unfortunately, they help only to a limited extent and result in worse text-to-image alignment.

Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to assess privacy for multi-modal models, specifically vision-language models like CLIP. The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.},

Trends of the global population of satellites need to be analyzed to test the viability and impact of proposed rules and laws affecting the satellite population and collision avoidance strategies. This requires large scale simulations of satellites that are propagated on long timescales to compute the large amounts of actionable close encounters (called conjunctions), which could lead to collisions. Rigorously checking for conjunctions by computing future states of orbits is computationally expensive due to the large amount of objects involved and conjunction filters are thus used to remove non-conjuncting orbit pairs from the list of possible conjunctions. In this work, we explore the possibility of machine learning (ML) based conjunction filters using several algorithms such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting, TabNet and (physics-informed) neural networks and deep operator networks. To show the viability and the potential of ML based filters, these algorithms are trained to predict the future state of orbits. For the physics-informed approaches, multiple partial differential equations are set up using the Kepler equation as a basis. The empirical results demonstrate that physics-informed deep operator networks are capable of predicting the future state of orbits using these equations (RMSE: 0.136) and outperform eXtreme Gradient Boosting (RMSE: 0.568) and TabNet (RMSE: 0.459). We also propose a filter based on the trained deep operator network which is shown to outperforms the filter capability of the commonly used perigee-apogee test and the orbit path filter on a synthetic dataset, while being on average 3.2 times faster to compute than a rigorous conjunction check.},

On our initial attempt of a naïve mapping between the formalism of adversarial examples and LPs, we quickly identify the key ingredients missing for making sense of a reasonable notion of adversarial examples for LPs. Intriguingly, the formalism of Pearl's notion to causality allows for the right description of adversarial like examples for LPs. Characteristically, we show the direct influence of the Structural Causal Model (SCM) onto the subsequent LP optimization, which ultimately exposes a notion of confounding in LPs (inherited by said SCM) that allows for adversarial-style attacks. We provide both the general proof formally alongside existential proofs of such intriguing LP-parameterizations based on SCM for three combinatorial problems, namely Linear Assignment, Shortest Path and a real world problem of energy systems.},

PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic ruless. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for NeSy ILP systems that can handle visual input to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is relatively unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neural-symbolic approach, NeSy-𝜋, to invent predicates from visual scenes for NeSy ILP systems based on clustering and extension of relational concepts.

NeSy-𝜋 processes visual scenes as input using deep neural networks for the visual perception and invents new concepts that support the task of classifying complex visual scenes. The invented concepts can be used by any NeSy ILP systems instead of hand-crafted background knowledge. Our experiments show that the PI model is capable of inventing high-level concepts and solving complex visual logic patterns more efficiently and accurately in the absence of explicit background knowledge.Moreover, the invented concepts are explainable and interpretable, while also providing competitive results with state-of-the-art NeSy ILP systems based on given knowledge.},

To report potential risks along pipelines, several steps are taken such as manual inspection and helicopter flights; however, these solutions are expensive and the flights are environmentally unfriendly. Deep learning has demonstrated considerable potential in handling a number of tasks in recent years as models rely on huge datasets to learn a specific task. With the increasing number of satellites orbiting the Earth, remote sensing data have become widely available, thus paving the way for automated pipeline monitoring via deep learning. This can result in effective risk detection, thereby reducing monitoring costs while being more precise and accurate. A major hindrance here is the low resolution of images obtained from the satellites, which makes it difficult to detect smaller changes. To this end, we propose to use transformers trained with low-resolution images in a change detection setting to detect pipeline risks. We collect PlanetScope satellite imagery (3 m resolution) that captures certain risks associated with the pipelines and present how we collected the data. Furthermore, we compare various state-of-the-art models, among which ChangeFormer, a transformer architecture for change detection, achieves the best performance with a 70% F1 score. As part of our evaluation, we discuss the specific performance requirements in pipeline monitoring and show how the model’s predictions can be shifted accordingly during training.},

Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts.

To mitigate this, we introduce the Vision rElation TransfOrmer (VETO), consisting of a novel local-level entity relation encoder.

To overcome this bias, we introduce a Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET) learning strategy that captures important relation features without bias towards head or tail classes. Experimental results on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that VETO + MEET boosts the predictive performance by up to 47\% over the state of the art while being 10x smaller.},

Nonetheless, most common self-play reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simply approximate   policy and value functions using convolutional neural networks (CNN). A key feature of CNNs is their relational inductive bias towards locality and translational invariance. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNN) can encode more complicated and distinct relational structures. Hence, we investigate the crucial question: Can GNNs, with their ability to encode complex connections, replace CNNs in self-play reinforcement learning? To this end, we do a comparison with Hex -- an abstract yet strategically rich board game -- serving as our experimental platform. Our findings reveal that GNNs excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in game states and are less prone to overfitting, but also showing a reduced proficiency in discerning local patterns. This suggests a potential paradigm shift, signaling the use of game-specific structures to reshape self-play reinforcement learning.},

We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names of individuals from models, and focus in this work on text encoders. Specifically, through strategic insertion of backdoors, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's name. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.},

Specifically, we create synthetic variations of all training samples, leveraging the inherent resilience of diffusion models to potential trigger patterns in the data.

We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in the textual description, common models reflect cultural biases in their generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively and identify a model’s text encoder as the root cause of the phenomenon. Such behavior can be interpreted as a model feature, offering users a simple way to customize the image generation and reflect their own cultural background. Yet, malicious users or service providers may also try to intentionally bias the image generation. One goal might be to create racist stereotypes by replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin scripts, so-called homoglyphs.

In contrast to current AI research that mainly treats explanations as a means for model inspection, a somewhat neglected finding from human psychology is the benefit of self-explaining in an agents' learning process. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel learning paradigm, termed Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX). The underlying idea is that a learning module (learner) performs a base task, e.g. image classification, and provides explanations to its decisions. An internal critic module next evaluates the quality of these explanations given the original task. Finally, the learner is refined with the critic's feedback and the loop is repeated as required. The intuition behind this is that an explanation is considered "good" if the critic can perform the same task given the respective explanation. Despite many implementation possibilities the structure of any LSX instantiation can be taxonomized based on four learning modules which we identify as: Fit, Explain, Reflect and Revise. In our work, we provide distinct instantiations of LSX for two different learner models, each illustrating different choices for the various LSX components. We broadly evaluate these on several datasets and show that Learning by Self-Explaining not only boosts the generalization abilities of AI models, particularly in small-data regimes, but also aids in mitigating the influence of confounding factors, as well as leading to more task specific and faithful model explanations. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence of the potential of self-explaining within the learning phase of an AI model.},

Specifically, they allow users to perform interventional interactions on these concepts by updating the concept values and thus correcting the predictive output of the model. Traditionally, however, these interventions are applied to the model only once and discarded afterward. To rectify this, we present concept bottleneck memory models (CB2M), an extension to CBMs. Specifically, a CB2M learns to generalize interventions to appropriate novel situations via a two-fold memory with which it can learn to detect mistakes and to reapply previous interventions. In this way, a CB2M learns to automatically improve model performance from a few initially obtained interventions. If no prior human interventions are available, a CB2M can detect potential mistakes of the CBM bottleneck and request targeted interventions. In our experimental evaluations on challenging scenarios like handling distribution shifts and confounded training data, we illustrate that CB2M are able to successfully generalize interventions to unseen data and can indeed identify wrongly inferred concepts. Overall, our results show that CB2M is a great tool for users to provide interactive feedback on CBMs, e.g., by guiding a user's interaction and requiring fewer interventions.},

	note         = {Neurally-parameterized Structural Causal Models in the Pearlian notion to causality, referred to as NCM, were recently introduced as a step towards next-generation learning systems. However, said NCM are only concerned with the learning aspect of causal inference and totally miss out on the architecture aspect. That is, actual causal inference within NCM is intractable in that the NCM won’t return an answer to a query in polynomial time. This insight follows as corollary to the more general statement on the intractability of arbitrary structural causal model (SCM) parameterizations, which we prove in this work through classical 3-SAT reduction. Since future learning algorithms will be required to deal with both high dimensional data and highly complex mechanisms governing the data, we ultimately believe work on tractable inference for causality to be decisive. We also show that not all “causal” models are created equal. More specifically, there are models capable of answering causal queries that are not SCM, which we refer to as partially causal models (PCM). We provide a tabular taxonomy in terms of tractability properties for all of the different model families, namely correlation-based, PCM and SCM. To conclude our work, we also provide some initial ideas on how to overcome parts of the intractability of causal inference with SCM by showing an example of how parameterizing an SCM with SPN modules can at least allow for tractable mechanisms. With this work we hope that our insights can raise awareness for this novel research direction since achieving success with causality in real world downstream tasks will not only depend on learning correct models but also require having the practical ability to gain access to model inferences.},

To overcome these limitations, we introduce 𝛼ILP, a novel differentiable inductive logic programming framework that learns to represent scenes as logic programs—intuitively, logical atoms correspond to objects, attributes, and relations, and clauses encode high-level scene information. 𝛼ILP has an end-to-end reasoning architecture from visual inputs. Using it, 𝛼ILP performs differentiable inductive logic programming on complex visual scenes, i.e., the logical rules are learned by gradient descent. Our extensive experiments on Kandinsky patterns and CLEVR-Hans benchmarks demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of 𝛼ILP in learning complex visual-logical concepts.},

However, recent SOTA DPPL approaches allow only for limited conditional probabilistic queries and do not offer the power of true joint probability estimation. In our work, we propose an easy integration of tractable probabilistic inference within a DPPL. To this end, we introduce SLASH, a novel DPPL that consists of Neural-Probabilistic Predicates (NPPs) and a logic program, united via answer set programming (ASP). NPPs are a novel design principle allowing for combining all deep model types and combinations thereof to be represented as a single probabilistic predicate. In this context, we introduce a novel +/− notation for answering various types of probabilistic queries by adjusting the atom notations of a predicate. To scale well, we show how to prune the stochastically insignificant parts of the (ground) program, speeding up reasoning without sacrificing the predictive performance. We evaluate SLASH on a variety of different tasks, including the benchmark task of MNIST addition and Visual Question Answering (VQA).},

While methods for marginalizing and abstracting SCM already exist today, they may destroy the causality of the marginalized model. To alleviate this, we introduce the concept of consolidating causal mechanisms to transform large-scale SCM while preserving consistent interventional behaviour.

To ease image generation, we propose MultiFusion that allows one to express complex and nuanced concepts with arbitrarily interleaved inputs of multiple modalities and languages. MutliFusion leverages pre-trained models and aligns them for integration into a cohesive system, thereby avoiding the need for extensive training from scratch. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficient transfer of capabilities from individual modules to the downstream model.

Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of additional memory since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This renders it difficult, if not impossible, to use explanations in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method relying on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics and models while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.},

This semantic guidance (SEGA) generalizes to any generative architecture using classifier-free guidance. More importantly, it allows for subtle and extensive edits, composition and style changes, and optimizing the overall artistic conception.

To overcome this problem, we propose NEUro-symbolic Message-pAssiNg reasoNer (NEUMANN), which is a graph-based differentiable forward reasoner, passing messages in a memory-efficient manner and handling structured programs with functors. Moreover, we propose a computationally-efficient structure learning algorithm to perform explanatory program induction on complex visual scenes. To evaluate, in addition to conventional visual reasoning tasks, we propose a new task, visual reasoning behind-the-scenes, where agents need to learn abstract programs and then answer queries by imagining scenes that are not observed. We empirically demonstrate that NEUMANN solves visual reasoning tasks efficiently, outperforming neural, symbolic, and neuro-symbolic baselines.},

Predicate Invention (PI) for ILP is the problem of discovering new concepts that describe hidden relationships in the domain. PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic ruless. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for NeSy ILP systems that can handle visual input to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is relatively unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neural-symbolic approach, NeSy-𝜋, to invent predicates from visual scenes for NeSy ILP systems based on clustering and extension of relational concepts. (𝜋 denotes the abbrivation of Predicate Invention). NeSy-𝜋 processes visual scenes as input using deep neural networks for the visual perception and invents new concepts that support the task of classifying complex visual scenes. The invented concepts can be used by any NeSy ILP systems instead of hand-crafted background knowledge. Our experiments show that the PI model is capable of inventing high-level concepts and solving complex visual logic patterns more efficiently and accurately in the absence of explicit background knowledge.Moreover, the invented concepts are explainable and interpretable, while also providing competitive results with state-of-the-art NeSy ILP systems based on given knowledge.},

However, outputs of these models rarely align with user's rationales for specific answers. In order to improve this alignment and reinforce commonsense reasons, we propose a tuning paradigm based on human interactions with machine generated data. Our ILLUME executes the following loop: Given an image-question-answer prompt, the VLM samples multiple candidate rationales, and a human critic provides minimal feedback via preference selection, used for fine-tuning. This loop increases the training data and gradually carves out the VLM's rationalization capabilities that are aligned with human intend. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that ILLUME is competitive with standard supervised fine-tuning while using significantly fewer training data and only requiring minimal feedback.},

In turn, they may even reinforce such biases. To help combat these undesired side effects, we present safe latent diffusion (SLD). Specifically, to measure the inappropriate degeneration due to unfiltered and imbalanced training sets, we establish a novel image generation test bed-inappropriate image prompts (I2P)-containing dedicated, real-world image-to-text prompts covering concepts such as nudity and violence. As our exhaustive empirical evaluation demonstrates, the introduced SLD removes and suppresses inappropriate image parts during the diffusion process, with no additional training required and no adverse effect on overall image quality or text alignment.},

To address this, we introduce the Vision rElation TransfOrmer (VETO), consisting of a novel entity part-level relation encoder. We further observe that many existing SGG methods claim to be unbiased, but are still biased towards either head or tail classes. To overcome this bias, we introduce a Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET) learning strategy that captures important relation features without bias towards head or tail classes. Exhaustive experimental results on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that VETO + MEET boosts the predictive performance by up to 47% over the state of the art while being ~10x smaller.},

Many text-guided image generation models rely on pre-trained text encoders from external sources, and their users trust that the retrieved models will behave as promised. Unfortunately, this might not be the case. We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demonstrate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk. Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no suspicious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. By then inserting a single character trigger into the prompt, e.g., a non-Latin character or emoji, the adversary can trigger the model to either generate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description. We empirically demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attacks on Stable Diffusion and highlight that the injection process of a single backdoor takes less than two minutes. Besides phrasing our approach solely as an attack, it can also force an encoder to forget phrases related to certain concepts, such as nudity or violence, and help to make image generation safer.},

In this work, we question the current common practice of storing all information in the model parameters and propose the Revision Transformer (RiT) employing information retrieval to facilitate easy model updating. The specific combination of a large-scale pre-trained LM that inherently but also diffusely encodes world knowledge with a clear-structured revision engine makes it possible to update the model's knowledge with little effort and the help of user interaction. We exemplify RiT on a moral dataset and simulate user feedback demonstrating strong performance in model revision even with small data.

To this end, we propose tractable dropout inference (TDI), an inference procedure to estimate uncertainty by deriving an analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) through variance propagation. Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network evaluations, TDI provides tractable sampling-free uncertainty estimates in a single forward pass. TDI improves the robustness of PCs to distribution shift and OOD data, demonstrated through a series of experiments evaluating the classification confidence and uncertainty estimates on real-world data.},

Unfortunately, despite their good object localization and segmentation capabilities, their object encodings may still be suboptimal for downstream reasoning tasks, such as reinforcement learning. To overcome this, we propose to exploit object motion and continuity (objects do not pop in and out of existence). This is accomplished through two mechanisms: (i) providing temporal loss-based priors on object locations, and (ii) a contrastive object continuity loss across consecutive frames. Rather than developing an explicit deep architecture, the resulting unsupervised Motion and Object Continuity (MOC) training scheme can be instantiated using any object detection model baseline. Our results show large improvements in the performances of variational and slot-based models in terms of object discovery, convergence speed and overall latent object representations, particularly for playing Atari games. Overall, we show clear benefits of integrating motion and object continuity for downstream reasoning tasks, moving beyond object representation learning based only on reconstruction as well as evaluation based only on instance segmentation quality.},

Hence, any implementation of AAM is forced to deal with the inherent uncertainties of human-inhabited spaces. Enabling growth and innovation requires the creation of a system for safe and robust mission design, i.e., the way we formalise intentions and decide their execution as trajectories for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Although legal frameworks have emerged to govern urban airspaces, their full integration into the decision process of autonomous agents and operators remains an open task. In this work we present ProMis, a system architecture for probabilistic mission design. It links the data available from various static and dynamic data sources with legal text and operator requirements by following principles of formal verification and probabilistic modeling. Using ProMis, combining low-level perception and high-level rules in AAM can be applied to the navigation frame of the UAV. To this end, we employ Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) as a unifying, intermediate representation between perception and action-taking. Furthermore, we present methods to connect ProMis with crowd-sourced map data by generating HPLP atoms that represent spatial relations in a probabilistic fashion. Our claims of the utility and generality of ProMis are supported by experiments on a diverse set of scenarios and a discussion of the computational demands associated with probabilistic missions.},

Here, we challenge this view and argue that they are a viable alternative for games with imperfect information—a domain currently dominated by heuristic approaches or methods explicitly designed for hidden information, such as oracle-based techniques. To this end, we introduce a novel algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, called AlphaZe**, which is an AlphaZero-based framework for games with imperfect information. We examine its learning convergence on the games Stratego and DarkHex and show that it is a surprisingly strong baseline, while using a model-based approach: it achieves similar win rates against other Stratego bots like Pipeline Policy Space Response Oracle (P2SRO), while not winning in direct comparison against P2SRO or reaching the much stronger numbers of DeepNash. Compared to heuristics and oracle-based approaches, AlphaZe** can easily deal with rule changes, e.g., when more information than usual is given, and drastically outperforms other approaches in this respect.},

Our extensive experiments in the face recognition domain show that Caia can accurately infer undisclosed sensitive attributes, such as an individual's hair color, gender and racial appearance, which are not part of the training labels. Interestingly, we demonstrate that adversarial robust models are even more vulnerable to such privacy leakage than standard models, indicating that a trade-off between robustness and privacy exists.},

	note         = {Approximate matching is a well-known concept in digital forensics to determine the similarity between digital artifacts.An important use case of approximate matching is the reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a blacklist (e.g., malware or corporate secrets), if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if only a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital forensic investigation, the approximate matching algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the blacklisted malware. However, traditional approximate matching functions like TLSH and ssdeep fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is relatively small compared to the overall file size (e.g., like one-third of the total file). A second well-known issue with traditional approximate matching algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the ever-increasing lookup databases. In this paper, we propose an improved matching algorithm based on transformer-based models from the field of natural language processing. We call our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM). As a concept from artificial intelligence, DLAM gets knowledge of characteristic blacklisted patterns during its training phase. Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in a typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment detection. Our evaluation is inspired by two widespread blacklist use cases: the detection of malware (e.g., in JavaScript) and corporate secrets (e.g., pdf or office documents). We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the prominent conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. First, it makes the tedious extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now before any search for them with approximate matching algorithms. This allows efficient classification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to exponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use case, DLAM achieves a similar (in case of mrsh-cf and mrsh-v2) or even significantly higher accuracy (in case of ssdeep and TLSH) in recovering fragments of blacklisted files. For instance, in the case of JavaScript files, our assessment shows that DLAM provides an accuracy of 93\% on our test corpus, while TLSH and ssdeep show a classification accuracy of only 50%. Third, we show that DLAM enables the detection of file correlations in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for fragment sizes, where the respective matching function of TLSH and ssdeep fails.},

In fact, they may even reinforce such biases. To not only uncover but also combat these undesired effects, we present a novel strategy, called Fair Diffusion, to attenuate biases after the deployment of generative text-to-image models. Specifically, we demonstrate shifting a bias, based on human instructions, in any direction yielding arbitrarily new proportions for, e.g., identity groups. As our empirical evaluation demonstrates, this introduced control enables instructing generative image models on fairness, with no data filtering and additional training required.},

We build upon recent successes of combining these two cuttingedge technologies and propose how Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning (XIL) is embedded in a generalizable Action Design Research (ADR) process – which we call XIL-ADR. This approach can be used to analyze data, inspect models, and iteratively improve them. We show the application of this process and use the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, e.g., Covid-19, as an illustrative example. By this means, this paper also illustrates how XIL-ADR can help identify shortcomings of standard machine learning projects, gain new insights on the part of the human user, and thereby help to tap the full potential of AI-based systems for organizations and research.},

On the contrary, text-guided image generation involves the user making many slight changes to inputs in order to iteratively carve out the envisioned image. However, slight changes to the input prompt often lead to entirely different images being generated, and thus the control of the artist is limited in its granularity. To provide flexibility, we present the Stable Artist, an image editing approach enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process. The main component is semantic guidance (SEGA) which steers the diffusion process along variable numbers of semantic directions. This allows for subtle edits to images, changes in composition and style, as well as optimization of the overall artistic conception. Furthermore, SEGA enables probing of latent spaces to gain insights into the representation of concepts learned by the model, even complex ones such as 'carbon emission'. We demonstrate the Stable Artist on several tasks, showcasing high-quality image editing and composition.},

Although the question has been identified as an interesting problem by the software community in online forums, it has not been investigated yet in adequate depth and scale, since the process of identifying the exact point in time when a vulnerability was introduced is particularly cumbersome. In this paper, we provide an automatic approach for accurately estimating how long vulnerabilities remain in the code (their lifetimes). Our method relies on the observation that while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact point of introduction for one vulnerability, it is possible to accurately estimate the average lifetime of a large enough sample of vulnerabilities, via a heuristic approach. With our approach, we perform the first large-scale measurement of Free and Open Source Software vulnerability lifetimes, going beyond approaches estimating lower bounds prevalent in previous research. We find that the average lifetime of a vulnerability is around 4 years, varying significantly between projects (~2 years for Chromium, ~7 years for OpenSSL). The distribution of lifetimes can be approximately described by an exponential distribution. There are no statistically significant differences between the lifetimes of different vulnerability types when considering specific projects. Vulnerabilities are getting older, as the average lifetime of fixed vulnerabilities in a given year increases over time, influenced by the overall increase of code age. However, they live less than non-vulnerable code, with an increasing spread over time for some projects, suggesting a notion of maturity that can be considered an indicator of quality. While the introduction of fuzzers does not significantly reduce the lifetimes of memory-related vulnerabilities, further research is needed to better understand and quantify the impact of fuzzers and other tools on vulnerability lifetimes and on the security of codebases.},

Typically, numerical data are used for the long-term correlation that is required for estimating the yield of new wind farm projects. However, VMMs can also be used to fill data gaps or during the operational phase as an additional reference data set to detect degrading sensors. The value of a VMM directly depends on its ability and precision to reproduce site-specific environmental conditions. Commonly, linear regression is used as state of the art to correct reference data to the site-specific conditions. In this study, a framework of 10 different machine-learning methods is tested to investigated the benefit of more advanced methods on two offshore and one onshore site. We find significantly improving correlations between the VMMs and the reference data when using more advanced methods and present the most promising ones. The K-Nearest Neighbors and AdaBoost regressors show the best results in our study, but Multi-Output Mixture of Gaussian Processes is also very promising. The use of more advanced regression models lead to decreased uncertainties; hence those methods should find its way into industrial applications.

The changes in metabolites, for example chlorophyll or flavonoids, have long been detectable using time-consuming destructive analytical methods including high-performance liquid chromatography or photometric determination. Recent plant phenotyping studies have revealed that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the UV-range can be used to link spectral changes with changes in plant metabolites. To compare established destructive analytical methods with new non-destructive hyperspectral measurements, the interaction between sugar beet leaves and the pathogens Cercospora beticola, which causes Cercospora leaf spot disease (CLS), and Uromyces betae, which causes sugar beet rust (BR), was investigated. With the help of destructive analyses, we showed that both diseases have different effects on chlorophylls, carotenoids, flavonoids, and several phenols. Non-destructive hyperspectral measurements in the UV-range revealed different effects of CLS and BR on plant metabolites resulting in distinct reflectance patterns. Both diseases resulted in specific spectral changes that allowed differentiation between the two diseases. Machine learning algorithms enabled the differentiation between the symptom classes and recognition of the two sugar beet diseases. Feature importance analysis identified specific wavelengths important to the classification, highlighting the utility of the UV-range. The study demonstrates that HSI in the UV-range is a promising, non-destructive tool to investigate the influence of plant diseases on plant physiology and biochemistry.},

The compass provides the visual means to both identify how approaches are practically reported and how works can simultaneously be contextualized in the broader literature landscape. In addition to promoting compact specification in the spirit of recent replication trends, the CLEVA-Compass thus provides an intuitive chart to understand the priorities of individual systems, where they resemble each other, and what elements are missing towards a fair comparison.},

This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets.

Moreover, we show that powerful MIAs are possible even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong distributional shifts, whereas previous approaches fail to produce meaningful results.

We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures. Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since overconfidence leads to high false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked than previously assumed. Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of models and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know, making low confidence predictions, the more they reveal the training data.},

To mitigate this severe practical restriction, we introduce a novel framework for verifying neural networks, named neuro-symbolic verification. The key idea is to use neural networks as part of the otherwise logical specification, enabling the verification of a wide variety of complex, real-world properties, including the one above.

Adapter layers are initialized randomly. However, existing work uses the same adapter architecture—i.e., the same adapter layer on top of each layer of the pretrained model—for every dataset, regardless of the properties of the dataset or the amount of available training data. In this work, we introduce adaptable adapters that contain (1) learning different activation functions for different layers and different input data, and (2) a learnable switch to select and only use the beneficial adapter layers. We show that adaptable adapters achieve on-par performances with the standard adapter architecture while using a considerably smaller number of adapter layers. In addition, we show that the selected adapter architecture by adaptable adapters transfers well across different data settings and similar tasks. We propose to use adaptable adapters for designing efficient and effective adapter architectures. The resulting adapters (a) contain about 50% of the learning parameters of the standard adapter and are therefore more efficient at training and inference, and require less storage space, and (b) achieve considerably higher performances in low-data settings},

This way, the programmer can describe how to generate samples almost like in any standard programming language.

In this context, we introduce a novel +/− notation for answering various types of probabilistic queries by adjusting the atom notations of a predicate.

Here we ask the arguably "circular" question of whether a machine can help us reflect on inappropriate content, answering Question 16 in Datasheets. To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets -- ImageNet and OpenImages -- produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.},

With anomaly attribution, explanations can be leveraged to understand, on a per-anomaly basis, which sensors cause the root of anomaly and which features are the most important in causing an anomaly. To this end, we propose using saliency-based Explainable-AI approaches to localize the essential sensors responsible for anomalies in an unsupervised manner.

As a linear program only provides the optimal solution to an optimization problem, further explanations are often helpful. In this work, we extend the attribution methods for explaining neural networks to linear programs. These methods explain the model by providing relevance scores for the model inputs, to show the influence of each input on the output. Alongside using classical gradient-based attribution methods we also propose a way to adapt perturbation-based attribution methods to LPs. Our evaluations of several different linear and integer problems showed that attribution methods can generate useful explanations for linear programs. However, we also demonstrate that using a neural attribution method directly might come with some drawbacks, as the properties of these methods on neural networks do not necessarily transfer to linear programs. The methods can also struggle if a linear program has more than one optimal solution, as a solver just returns one possible solution.

Specifically, since structure discovery is a key problem in science and beyond, we want to be invariant to the scale being used for measuring our data (e.g. meter versus centimeter should not affect the causal direction inferred by the algorithm). In this work, we further strengthen this initial, negative empirical suggestion by both proving key results in the multivariate case and corroborating with further empirical evidence.

This is unfortunate, since PCs allow a much wider range of probabilistic inference routines than main-stream generative models, such as exact and efficient marginalization and conditioning. Motivated by the success of loss reframing in deep generative models, we incorporate perceptual metrics into the PC learning objective. To this aim, we introduce a differentiable sampling procedure for PCs, where the central challenge is the non-differentiability of sampling from the categorical distribution over latent PC variables. We take advantage of the Gumbel-Softmax trick and develop a novel inference pass to smoothly interpolate child samples as a strategy to circumvent non-differentiability of sum node sampling. We initially hypothesized, that  perceptual losses, unlocked by our novel differentiable sampling procedure, will elevate the generative power of PCs and improve their sample quality to be on par with neural counterparts like probabilistic auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks. Although our experimental findings empirically reject this hypothesis for now, the results demonstrate that samples drawn from PCs optimized with perceptual losses can have similar sample quality compared to likelihood-based optimized PCs and, at the same time, can express richer contrast, colors, and details. Whereas before, PCs were restricted to likelihood-based optimization, this work has paved the way to advance PCs with loss formulations that have been built around deep neural networks in recent years.},

This typology can thus be used to categorize existing and future XIL methods based on the identified modules. Moreover, our work contributes by surveying six existing XIL methods. In addition to benchmarking these methods on their overall ability to revise a model, we perform additional benchmarks regarding wrong reason revision, interaction efficiency, robustness to feedback quality, and the ability to revise a strongly corrupted model. Apart from introducing these novel benchmarking tasks, for improved quantitative evaluations, we further introduce a novel Wrong Reason (WR) metric which measures the average wrong reason activation in a model's explanations to complement a qualitative inspection. In our evaluations, all methods prove to revise a model successfully. However, we found significant differences between the methods on individual benchmark tasks, revealing valuable application-relevant aspects not only for comparing current methods but also to motivate the necessity of incorporating these benchmarks in the development of future XIL methods.},

The computed ‘moral direction’ can rate the normativity (or non-normativity) of arbitrary phrases without explicitlytraining the LM for this task, reflecting social norms well.

A characteristic of these representations is that they give rise to a huge number of features to be considered, thus drastically increasing the difficulty of learning in terms of computational complexity and the curse of dimensionality. Despite this, methods for ranking features in this context, i.e., estimating their importance are practically non-existent. Among the most well-known methods for feature ranking are those based on ensembles, and in particular tree ensembles. To develop methods for feature ranking in a relational context, we adopt the relational tree ensemble approach. We thus first develop methods for learning ensembles of relational trees, extending a wide spectrum of tree-based ensemble methods from the propositional to the relational context, resulting in methods for bagging and random forests of relational trees, as well as gradient boosted ensembles thereof. Complex relational features are considered in our ensembles: by using complex aggregates, we extend the standard collection of features that correspond to existential queries, such as `Does this person have any children?', to more complex features that correspond to aggregation queries, such as `What is the average age of this person's children?'. We also calculate feature importance scores and rankings from the different kinds of relational tree ensembles learned, with different kinds of relational features. The rankings provide insight into and explain the ensemble models, which would be otherwise difficult to understand. We compare the methods for learning single trees and different tree ensembles, using only existential qualifiers and using the whole set of relational features, against 10 state-of-the-art methods on a collection of benchmark relational datasets, deriving also the corresponding feature rankings. Overall, the bagging ensembles perform the best, with gradient boosted ensembles following closely. The use of aggregates is beneficial and in some datasets drastically improves performance: In these cases, aggregate-based features clearly stand out in the feature rankings derived from the ensembles.},

Here we ask the arguably "circular" question of whether a machine can help us reflect on inappropriate content, answering Question 16 in Datasheets. To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets -- ImageNet and OpenImages -- produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.},

A number of works have been proposed to revise deep classifiers to learn the right correlations. However, generative models have been overlooked so far. We observe that generative models are also prone to Clever-Hans-like behaviour. To counteract this issue, we propose to debias generative models by disentangling their internal representations, which is achieved via human feedback. Our experiments show that this is effective at removing bias even when human feedback covers only a small fraction of the desired distribution.

Yet many existing approaches rely on the use of a set of fixed, preprogrammed joint configurations for expression generation. Automating this process provides potential advantages to scale better to different robot types and various expressions. To this end, we introduce ExGenNet, a novel deep generative approach for facial expressions on humanoid robots. ExGenNets connect a generator network to reconstruct simplified facial images from robot joint configurations with a classifier network for state-of-the-art facial expression recognition. The robots’ joint configurations are optimized for various expressions by backpropagating the loss between the predicted expression and intended expression through the classification network and the generator network. To improve the transfer between human training images and images of different robots, we propose to use extracted features in the classifier as well as in the generator network. Unlike most studies on facial expression generation, ExGenNets can produce multiple configurations for each facial expression and be transferred between robots. Experimental evaluations on two robots with highly humanlike faces, Alfie (Furhat Robot) and the android robot Elenoide, show that ExGenNet can successfully generate sets of joint configurations for predefined facial expressions on both robots. This ability of ExGenNet to generate realistic facial expressions was further validated in a pilot study where the majority of human subjects could accurately recognize most of the generated facial expressions on both the robots.},

The key idea is to combine differentiable forward-chaining reasoning with object-centric (deep) learning. Differentiable forward-chaining reasoning computes logical entailments smoothly, i.e., it deduces new facts from given facts and rules in a differentiable manner. The object-centric learning approach factorizes raw inputs into representations in terms of objects. Thus, it allows us to provide a consistent framework to perform the forward-chaining inference from raw inputs. NSFR factorizes the raw inputs into the object-centric representations, converts them into probabilistic ground atoms, and finally performs differentiable forward-chaining inference using weighted rules for inference. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on object-centric reasoning data sets, 2D Kandinsky patterns and 3D CLEVR-Hans, and a variety of tasks show the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.},

Introduced and extensively investigated in the past decade, the neural probabilistic circuits known as sum-product network (SPN) offers linear time complexity. On another note, research around neural causal models (NCM) recently gained traction, demanding a tighter integration of causality for machine learning. To this end, we present a theoretical investigation of if, when, how and under what cost tractability occurs for different NCM. We prove that SPN-based causal inference is generally tractable, opposed to standard MLP-based NCM. We further introduce a new tractable NCM-class that is efficient in inference and fully expressive in terms of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy. Our comparative empirical illustration on simulations and standard benchmarks validates our theoretical proofs.},

In contrast, deep probabilistic models such as sum-product networks (SPNs) capture joint distributions and ensure tractable inference, but still lack the expressive power of intractable models based on deep neural networks. In this paper, we introduce conditional SPNs (CSPNs)---conditional density estimators for multivariate and potentially hybrid domains---and develop a structure-learning approach that derives both the structure and parameters of CSPNs from data. To harness the expressive power of deep neural networks (DNNs), we also show how to realise CSPNs by conditioning the parameters of vanilla SPNs on the input using DNNs as gate functions. In experiments, we demonstrate that CSPNs are competitive with other probabilistic models and yield superior performance on structured prediction, conditional density estimation, auto-regressive image modeling, and multilabel image classification. In particular, we show that employing CSPNs as encoders and decoders within  variational autoencoders can help to relax the commonly used mean field assumption and in turn improve performance.},

Consequently, there is an urgent need to carefully document datasets and curate their content. Unfortunately, this process is tedious and error-prone. We show that pre-trained transformers themselves provide a methodology for the automated curation of large-scale vision datasets. Based on human-annotated examples and the implicit knowledge of a CLIP based model, we demonstrate that one can select relevant prompts for rating the offensiveness of an image.

We introduce the first connection between relational rule models and probabilistic circuits, obtaining tractable inference from discriminative rule models while operating on the relational domain. Specifically, given a relational rule model, we make use of Mixed Sum-Product Networks (MSPNs)--—a deep probabilistic architecture for hybrid domains--—to equip them with a full joint distribution over the class and how (often) the rules fire. Our empirical evaluation shows that we can answer a widerange of probabilistic queries on relational data while being robust to missing, out-of-domain data and partial counts. We show that our method generalizes todifferent distributions outperforming strong baselines. Moreover, due to the clear probabilistic semantics of MSPNs we have informative model interpretations.},

Given their accuracy performance, currently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the models of choice for this task. Despite their success in time series forecasting, less attention has been paid to make the RNNs trustworthy. For example, RNNs can not naturally provide an uncertainty measure to their predictions. This could be extremely useful in practice in several cases e.g. to detect when a prediction might be completely wrong due to an unusual pattern in the time series. Whittle Sum-Product Networks (WSPNs), prominent deep tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs) for time series, can assist an RNN with providing meaningful probabilities as uncertainty measure. With this aim, we propose RECOWN, a novel architecture that employs RNNs and a discriminant variant of WSPNs called Conditional WSPNs (CWSPNs). We also formulate a Log-Likelihood Ratio Score as an estimation of uncertainty that is tailored to time series and Whittle likelihoods. In our experiments, we show that RECOWNs are accurate and trustworthy time series predictors, able to "know when they do not know".},

	note         = {Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. While approaches for axis-aligned bounding box detection have made substantial progress in recent years, they perform poorly on oriented objects which are common in several realworld scenarios such as aerial view imagery and security camera footage. In these cases, a large part of a predicted bounding box will, undesirably, cover non-object related areas. Therefore, oriented object detection has emerged with the aim of generalizing object detection to arbitrary orientations. This enables a tighter fit to oriented objects, leading to a better separation of bounding boxes especially in case of dense object distributions. The vast majority of the work in this area has focused on complex two-stage anchor-based approaches, where the detection is split into a region-of-interest identification step followed by the object localization and classification based on sets of predefined bounding box anchors. These anchors act as priors on the bounding box shape and require attentive hyper-parameter fine-tuning on a perdataset basis, increased model size, and come with computational overhead. In this work, we present DAFNe: A Dense one-stage Anchor-Free deep Network for oriented object detection. As a one-stage model, DAFNe performs predictions on a dense grid over the input image, being architecturally simpler in design, as well as easier to optimize than its twostage counterparts. Furthermore, as an anchor-free model, DAFNe reduces the prediction complexity by refraining from employing bounding box anchors. Moreover, we introduce an orientation-aware generalization of the center-ness function for arbitrarily oriented bounding boxes to down-weight low-quality predictions and a center-to-corner bounding box prediction strategy that improves object localization performance. Our experiments show that, to the best of our knowledge, DAFNe outperforms all previous one-stage anchor-free models on DOTA 1.0. DAFNe improves the prediction accuracy over the previous best results by 4.65% mAP, setting the new state-of-the-art results by achieving 76.95% mAP.},

We further show that such attacks can be determined by the hidden confounders in a domain, thus drawing a novel connection between such attacks and causality. Establishing this causal perspective is characterized by the influence of the structural causal model's data generating process on the subsequent optimization thereby exhibiting intriguing parameters of the former. We reveal the existence of such parameters for three combinatorial optimization problems, namely linear assignment, shortest path and a real world problem of energy systems. Our empirical examination also unveils worrisome consequences of these attacks on differentiable perturbed optimizers thereby highlighting the criticality of our findings.},

To address this contradiction, we introduce a concept using different initial environments as input while using a single Neural Cellular Automata to produce several outputs. Additionally, we introduce GANCA, a novel algorithm that combines Neural Cellular Automata with Generative Adversarial Networks, allowing for more generalization through adversarial training.

Specifically, we propose Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to extract the labels of the users’ training data from their shared gradients. The attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We empirically and mathematically demonstrate the validity of our attack under different settings. Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient compression is a practical technique to prevent our attack.},

However, for high-dimensional input data such as images, the individual symbols, i.e. pixels, are not easily interpretable. We introduce the concept of first-order convolutional rules, which are logical rules that can be extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and whose complexity depends on the size of the convolutional filter and not on the dimensionality of the input. Our approach is based on rule extraction from binary neural networks with stochastic local search. We show how to extract rules that are not necessarily short, but characteristic of the input, and easy to visualize. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is able to model the functionality of the neural network while at the same time producing interpretable logical rules.},

We show that inference can be performed exactly and efficiently in our model, that it can capture correlations between output dimensions and, hence, often outperforms approaches that do not incorporate inter-output correlations, as demonstrated on several datasets in terms of the negative log predictive density.},

To this end, we propose the first probabilistic circuits (PCs) approach to model time series, called Whittle sum-product networks (WSPNs). WSPNs leverage the Whittle approximation, casting the likelihood in the frequency domain, and place a complex-valued sum-product network, the most prominent PC, over the frequencies. The conditional independence relations among the time series can then be determined efficiently in the spectral domain. Moreover, WSPNs can naturally be placed into the deep neural learning stack for time series, resulting in Whittle Networks, opening the likelihood toolbox for training deep neural models and inspecting their behaviour. Our experiments show that Whittle Networks can indeed capture complex dependencies between time series and provide a useful measure of uncertainty for neural networks.},

These vectors are used independently to condition a NeRF decoder, defining the geometry and appearance of each object. We make learning more computationally efficient by deriving a novel loss, which allows training NeRFs on RGB-D inputs without explicit ray marching. After confirming that the model performs equal or better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, we apply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and a novel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find that after training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of not only recovering the 3D geometry of a scene depicted in a single input image, but also to segment it into objects, despite receiving no supervision in that regard.},

These and other successes are exciting. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from degenerate and biased behaviour. While this is well established, we show that recent improvements of LMs also store ethical and moral values of the society and actually bring a ``moral dimension'' to surface: the values are capture geometrically by a direction in the embedding space, reflecting well the agreement of phrases to social norms implicitly expressed in the training texts. This provides a path for attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs. Since one can now rate the (non-)normativity of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, the moral dimension can be used as ``moral compass'' guiding (even other) LMs towards producing normative text, as we will show.},

We compiled a novel confounded visual scene data set, the CLEVR-Hans data set, capturing complex compositions of different objects. The results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can identify confounders that are not identifiable using "visual" explanations only. More importantly, feedback on this semantic level makes it possible to revise the model from focusing on these confounding factors.},

In this study, the plant-pathogen interactions of three different barley lines inoculated with Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh, powdery mildew) were carried out. One susceptible genotype (Ingrid wild type) and two resistant genotypes (Pallas 01, Mla1 and Mla12 based resistance and Pallas 22, mlo5 based resistance) were used. During the first 5 days after inoculation (dai) the plant reflectance patterns were recorded and in parallel plant metabolites relevant in host-pathogen interaction were studied. Hyperspectral measurements in the UV-range revealed that a differentiation between resistant and susceptible barley genotypes inoculated with Bgh is possible and distinct reflectance patterns were recorded for each genotype. The extracted and analyzed pigments and flavonoids correlated with the spectral data recorded. A classification of non-inoculated and inoculated samples with deep learning revealed that a high performance was achieved with self-attention networks. The subsequent feature importance identified wavelengths, which were most important for the classification, and these wavelengths were linked to pigments and flavonoids. Hyperspectral imaging in the UV-range allows for a characterisation of different resistance reactions, can be linked to changes of secondary plant metabolites with the advantage of being a non-invasive method and therefore enables a greater understanding of the plants' reaction to biotic stress as well as resistance reactions.},

	note         = {Explaining black-box models such as deep neural networks is becoming increasingly important as it helps to boost trust and debugging. Popular forms of explanations map the features to a vector indicating their individual importance to a decision on the instance-level. They can then be used to prevent the model from learning the wrong bias in data possibly due to ambiguity. For instance, Ross et al.'s "right for the right reasons" propagates user explanations backwards to the network by formulating differentiable constraints based on input gradients. Unfortunately, input gradients as well as many other widely used explanation methods form an approximation of the decision boundary and assume the underlying model to be fixed. Here, we demonstrate how to make use of influence functions - a well known robust statistic - in the constraints to correct the model’s behaviour more effectively. Our empirical evidence demonstrates that this "right for better reasons" (RBR) considerably reduces the time to correct the classifier at training time and boosts the quality of explanations at inference time compared to input gradients. Besides, we also showcase the effectiveness of RBR in correcting "Clever Hans"-like behaviour in real, high-dimensional domain.},

We introduce a new, improved search algorithm for AlphaZero which generalizes the search tree to a directed acyclic graph. This enables information ﬂow across different subtrees and greatly reduces memory consumption.

Consequently, we propose to intervene on a Neuro-Symbolic scene representation, which allows one to revise the model on the semantic level, e.g. "never focus on the color to make your decision". We compiled a novel confounded visual scene data set, the CLEVR-Hans data set, capturing complex compositions of different objects. The results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can identify confounders that are not identifiable using "visual" explanations only. More importantly, feedback on this semantic level makes it possible to revise the model from focusing on these confounding factors.},

Providing an arbitrarily intervened causal graph as input, effectively subsuming Pearl's do-operator, the gate function predicts the parameters of the SPN. The resulting interventional SPNs are motivated and illustrated by a structural causal model themed around personal health. Our empirical evaluation on three benchmark data sets as well as a synthetic health data set clearly demonstrates that interventional SPNs indeed are both expressive in modelling and flexible in adapting to the interventions.},

Then, two non-intrusive data-driven approaches are proposed, which are built upon artificial neural networks and formulated such that they also fulfill the objectivity and material symmetry conditions. Finally, a hybrid approach combing the approach of Itskov (2001) with artificial neural networks is formulated. Here, all four models are calibrated with simulation data of the homogenization of two cubic lattice metamaterials at finite deformations. The data-driven models are able to reproduce the calibration data very well and reproduce the manifestation of lattice instabilities. Furthermore, they achieve superior accuracy over the analytical model also in additional test scenarios. The introduced hyperelastic models are formulated as general as possible, such that they can not only be used for lattice structures, but for any anisotropic hyperelastic material.

Therefore, we introduce conditional SPNs (CSPNs), conditional density estimators for multivariate and potentially hybrid domains that allow harnessing the expressive power of neural networks while still maintaining tractability guarantees. One way to implement CSPNs is to use an existing SPN structure and condition its parameters on the input, e.g., via a deep neural network. Our experimental evidence demonstrates that CSPNs are competitive with other probabilistic models and yield superior performance on multilabel image classification compared to mean field and mixture density networks.

This adds references to substructures across the SPNs at different depths, which in turn helps to improve training. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting residual SPNs (ResSPNs) are easy to optimize, gain performance from considerably increased depth and width, and are competitive to state-of-the-art SPN structure learning approaches.

Here, all four models are calibrated with simulation data of the homogenization of two cubic lattice metamaterials at finite deformations. The data-driven models are able to reproduce the calibration data very well and reproduce the manifestation of lattice instabilities. Furthermore, they achieve superior accuracy over the analytical model also in additional test scenarios. The introduced hyperelastic models are formulated as general as possible, such that they can not only be used for lattice structures, but for any anisotropic hyperelastic material. Further, access to the complete simulation data is provided through the public repository https://github.com/CPShub/sim-data.},

Combining deep classifiers with knowledge expressed in the form of rules and constraints allows one to leverage different forms of abstractions within argumentation mining. Argumentation for ma-chine learning can yield argumentation-based learning methods where the machine and the user argue about the learned model with the common goal of providing results of maximum utility to the user. Unfortunately, both directions are currently rather challenging. For instance, combining deep neural models with logic typically only yields determinisic results, while combining probabilistic models with logic often results in intractable inference. Therefore, we review a novel deep but tractable model for conditional probability distributions  that  can  harness  the  expressive  power  of universal  function  approximators such  as  neural  networks while still maintaining a wide range of tractable inference routines. While this new model has shown appealing performance in classification tasks, humans cannot easily under-stand the reasons for its decision. Therefore, we also review our recent efforts on how to “argue” with deep models. On synthetic and real data we illustrate how “arguing” with a deep model about its explanations can actually help to revise the model, if it is right for the wrong reasons. We only sketch and review our recent efforts. More details can be found in the corresponding publications as well as current submissions to conferences and journals.},

In this paper, we propose Einsum Networks (EiNets), a novel implementation design for PCs, improving prior art in several regards. At their core, EiNets combine a large number of arithmetic operations in a single monolithic einsum-operation, leading to speedups and memory savings of up to two orders of magnitude, in comparison to previous implementations. As an algorithmic contribution, we show that the implementation of Expectation-Maximization (EM) can be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EiNets scale well to datasets which were previously out of reach, such as SVHN and CelebA, and that they can be used as faithful generative image models.},

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? In this study, we show that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about ``right" and ``wrong" conduct. We create a template list of prompts and responses, such as ``Should I [action]?'', ``Is it okay to [action]?'', etc. with corresponding answers of ``Yes/no, I should (not).'' and "Yes/no, it is (not)." The model's bias score is now the difference between the model's score of the positive response (``Yes, I should'') and that of the negative response (``No, I should not''). For a given choice, the model's overall bias score is the mean of the bias scores of all question/answer templates paired with that choice. Specifically, the resulting model, called the Moral Choice Machine (MCM), calculates the bias score on a sentence level using embeddings of the Universal Sentence Encoder since the moral value of an action to be taken depends on its context. It is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time. It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt. It is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and moral choices, even with context information. Actually, training the Moral Choice Machine on different temporal news and book corpora from year 1510 to 2008/09 demonstrate the evolution of moral and ethical choices over different time periods for both atomic actions and actions with context information. By training it on different cultural sources such as the Bible and the constitution of different countries, dynamics of moral choices in culture, including technology are revealed. That is the fact that moral biases can be extracted, quantified, tracked, and compared across cultures and over time.},

Crazyhouse is a game with a higher branching factor than chess and there is only limited data of lower quality available compared to AlphaGo. Therefore, we focus on improving efficiency in multiple aspects while relying on low computational resources. These improvements include modifications in the neural network design and training configuration, the introduction of a data normalization step and a more sample efficient Monte-Carlo tree search which has a lower chance to blunder. After training on 569,537 human games for 1.5 days we achieve a move prediction accuracy of 60.4%. During development, versions of CrazyAra played professional human players. Most notably, CrazyAra achieved a four to one win over 2017 crazyhouse world champion Justin Tan (aka LM Jann Lee) who is more than 400 Elo higher rated compared to the average player in our training set.

Second, training data has to be recollected when the workload and the data changes. To overcome these limitations, we take a different route: we propose to learn a pure data-driven model which learns the basic characteristics of a given database. As a result, our data-driven approach not only supports ad-hoc queries but also updates of the data without the need to retrain when the workload or data changes. Indeed, one may expect that this comes at a price of lower accuracy since workload-driven models can make use of more information. However, asour empirical evaluation demonstrate our data-driven approach can not only provide better accuracy than state-of-the-art learned components but also generalizes better to unseen queries.},

The main focus of these works was to leverage the expressive power of deep neural networks within probabilistic programming systems. In particular, DeepProblog targets similar goals in the relational setting, by allowing probabilistic predicates to be specified as (conditional) distributions defined via deep neural networks. The resulting systems allow relational probabilistic models with deep components to be trained end-to-end. However, in this setting, deep models are used purely as conditional density estimators. This limits the types of inferences that are possible in the resulting system: Lacking any model for the inputs of the neural network, missing values can not be inferred or sampled. To overcome these obstacles we propose a novel deep relational probabilistic PL — "SPLog: Sum-Product Logic", the main components of which are Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and ProbLog. SPNs are a type of deep generative model with the crucial property that all conditional and marginal queries may be answered exactly in linear time. In this extended abstract, we show how to leverage this feature in the context of Problog, i.e., how to include SPNs as components within Problog programs, and how to perform joint training and inference.},

Using cryptographic techniques, it is possible to perform inference tasks remotely on sensitive client data in a privacy-preserving way: the server learns nothing about the input data and the model predictions, while the client learns nothing about the ML model (which is often considered intellectual property and might contain traces of sensitive data). While such privacy-preserving solutions are relatively efficient, they are mostly targeted at neural networks, can degrade the predictive accuracy, and usually reveal the network’s topology. Furthermore, existing solutions are not readily accessible to ML experts, as prototype implementations are not well-integrated into ML frameworks and require extensive cryptographic knowledge. In this paper, we present CryptoSPN, a framework for privacypreserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs). SPNs are a tractable probabilistic graphical model that allows a range of exact inference queries in linear time. Specifically, we show how to efficiently perform SPN inference via secure multi-party computation (SMPC) without accuracy degradation while hiding sensitive client and training information with provable security guarantees. Next to foundations, CryptoSPN encompasses tools to easily transform existing SPNs into privacy-preserving executables. Our empirical results demonstrate that CryptoSPN achieves highly efficient and accurate inference in the order of seconds for medium-sized SPNs.},

	note         = {Commercial success of modern freemium games hinges on player satisfaction and retention. This calls for the customization of game content or game mechanics in order to keep players engaged. However, whereas game content is already frequently generated using procedural content generation, methods that can reliably assess what kind of content suits a player’s skills or preferences are still few and far between. Addressing this challenge, we propose novel recommender systems based on latent factor models that allow for recommending quests in a single player role-playing game. In particular, we introduce a tensor factorization algorithm to decompose collections of bipartite matrices which represent how players’ interests and behaviors change over time. Extensive online bucket type tests during the ongoing operation of a commercial game reveal that our system is able to recommend more engaging quests and to retain more players than previous handcrafted or collaborative filtering approaches.},

Also the inference in so-called Sum-Product Networks, a subclass of Probabilistic Graphical Models, can be accelerated efficiently using a pipelined FPGA architecture. However, as Sum-Product Networks compute exact probability values, the required arithmetic precision poses different challenges than those encountered with Neural Networks. In previous work, this precision was maintained by using double-precision floating-point number formats, which are expensive to implement in FPGAs. In this work, we propose the use of a logarithmic number scale format tailored specifically towards the inference in Sum- Product Networks. The evaluation of our optimized arithmetic hardware operators shows that the use of logarithmic number formats allows to save up to 50% hardware resources compared to double-precision floating point, while maintaining sufficient precision for SPN inference and almost identical performance.},

But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about "right" and "wrong" conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass? In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.},

Second, training data has to be recollected when the workload and the data changes. To overcome these limitations, we take a different route: we propose to learn a pure data-driven model that can be used for different tasks such as query answering or cardinality estimation. This data-driven model also supports ad-hoc queries and updates of the data without the need of full retraining when the workload or data changes. Indeed, one may now expect that this comes at a price of lower accuracy since workload-driven models can make use of more information. However, this is not the case. The results of our empirical evaluation demonstrate that our data-driven approach not only provides better accuracy than state-of-the-art learned components but also generalizes better to unseen queries.},

With this paper, we present CrazyAra which is a neural network based engine solely trained in supervised manner for the chess variant crazyhouse. Crazyhouse is a game with a higher branching factor than chess and there is only limited data of lower quality available compared to AlphaGo. Therefore, we focus on improving efficiency in multiple aspects while relying on low computational resources. These improvements include modifications in the neural network design and training configuration, the introduction of a data normalization step and a more sample efficient Monte-Carlo tree search which has a lower chance to blunder. After training on 569,537 human games for 1.5 days we achieve a move prediction accuracy of 60.4%. During development, versions of CrazyAra played professional human players. Most notably, CrazyAra achieved a four to one win over 2017 crazyhouse world champion Justin Tan (aka LM Jann Lee) who is more than 400 Elo higher rated compared to the average player in our training set. Furthermore, we test the playing strength of CrazyAra on CPU against all participants of the second Crazyhouse Computer Championships 2017, winning against twelve of the thirteen participants. Finally, for CrazyAraFish we continue training our model on generated engine games. In ten long-time control matches playing Stockfish 10, CrazyAraFish wins three games and draws one out of ten matches.},

Here, we demonstrate how to eliminate the reliance on first picking fixed activation functions by using flexible parametric rational functions instead.

Our empirical evidence shows that end-to-end learning deep networks with PAUs can increase the predictive performance and reduce the training time of common deep architectures.

To this end, we propose a ``classical deep learning approach'', i.e., generate an unspecialized random structure scaling up to millions of parameters, and then apply modern GPU-based optimizers with regularization. That is, we investigating the performance of SPNs in the absence of carefully selected structures. As it turns out, our models perform on par with state-of-the-art SPN structure learners and deep neural networks on a diverse range of generative and discriminative scenarios. Most importantly, they yield well-calibrated uncertainties, thus standing out among most deep generative and discriminative models in being robust to missing features and detecting anomalies.},

However, inference in the overall model is highly intractable, which hampers its learning speed and makes it prone to sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we show that inference and learning in AIR can be considerably accelerated by replacing the intractable object representations with tractable probabilistic models. In particular, we opt for sum-product (SP) networks, an expressive deep probabilistic model with a rich set of tractable inference routines. As our empirical evidence shows, the resulting model, called SuPAIR, achieves a higher object detection accuracy than the original AIR system, while reducing the learning time by an order of magnitude.

In this paper, we explore the case where there are no entities that are directly suitable for grouping. We propose to use methods from Gaussian mixture fitting to identify entity groups, such that the error imposed by grouping them (by approximating their properties by a distribution) is minimal. Furthermore, we show how Gaussian mixture merging methods can be used to prevent the number of groups from growing indefinitely over time. We evaluate our approach on an activity prediction task in an online multiplayer game.

Ultimately, StarAI may provide good starting points for developing Systems AI—the computational and mathematical modeling of complex AI systems—and in turn an engineering discipline for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This Research Topic "Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence”2aims at presenting an overview of the latest approaches in StarAI. This topic was followed by a summer school1held in 2018 in Ferrara, Italy, as part of the series of Advanced Courses on AI (ACAI) promoted by the European Association for Artificial Intelligence.},

The ultraviolet range (UV, 200-380 nm) has not yet been used in plant phenotyping even though a number of plant molecules like flavones and phenol feature absorption maxima in this range. In this study an imaging UV line scanner in the range of 250 - 430 nm is introduced to investigate crop plants for plant phenotyping. Observing plants in the UV-range can provide information about important changes of plant substances. To record reliable and reproducible time series results, measurement conditions were defined that exclude phototoxic effects of UV-illumination in the plant tissue. The measurement quality of the UV-camera has been assessed by comparing it to a non-imaging UV-spectrometer by measuring six different white-colored plant-based substances. Given the findings of these preliminary studies, an experiment has been defined and performed monitoring the stress response of barley leaves to salt stress. The aim was to visualize the effects of abiotic stress within the UV-range to provide new insights into the stress response of plants visualizing the effects of abiotic stress within the UV-range to provide new insights into the stress response of plants at the example of the stress response of barley leaves to salt stress. Our study demonstrated the first use of a hyperspectral sensor in the UV-range for stress detection in plant phenotyping.},

We propose the use of probabilistic context-free grammars to sequence a series of primitives to generate complex robot policies from a given library of primitives. The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However, the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the posteriors of the grammars given the observations. Restrictions over operators connecting the search define the corresponding proposal distributions and, therefore, guide the optimization additionally. In experiments, we validate our method on a redundant 7 degree-of-freedom lightweight robotic arm on tasks that require the generation of complex sequences of motions out of simple primitives.},

Most previous work on learning AC structures, however, hinges on inducing a tree-structured AC and, hence, may potentially break loops that may exist in the true generative model. To repair such broken loops, we propose a gradient-boosted method for structure learning of discriminative ACs (DACs), called DACBOOST. Since, in discrete domains, ACs are essentially equivalent to mixtures of trees, DACBOOST decomposes a large AC into smaller tree-structured ACs and learns them in a sequential, additive manner. The resulting non-parametric manner of learning the DACs results in a model with very few tuning parameters making our learned model significantly more efficient. We demonstrate on standard data sets and some real-world data sets, the efficiency of DACBOOST compared to the state-of-the-art DAC learners without sacrificing the effectiveness. This makes it possible to employ DACs for large scale real-world tasks.},

Moreover, many of the algorithms proposed in the literature to learn the structure and parameters of SPNs are readily available in SPFlow. Furthermore, SPFlow is extremely extensible and customizable, allowing users to promptly distill new inference and learning routines by injecting custom code into a lightweight functional-oriented API framework. This is achieved in SPFlow by keeping an internal Python representation of the graph structure that also enables practical compilation of an SPN into a TensorFlow graph, C, CUDA or FPGA custom code, significantly speeding-up computations.},

In the past years, the database community has been working on different techniques for Approximate Query Processing (AQP) that aim to deliver an approximate query result given a fixed time bound to support interactive visualizations better. However, classical AQP approaches suffer from various problems that limit the applicability to support the ad-hoc exploration of a new data set: (1) Classical AQP approaches that perform online sampling can support ad-hoc exploration queries but yield low quality if executed over rare subpopulations. (2) Classical AQP approaches that rely on offline sampling can use some form of biased sampling to mitigate these problems but require a priori knowledge of the workload, which is often not realistic if users want to explore a new database. In this paper, we present a new approach to AQP called Model-based AQP that leverages generative models learned over the complete database to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds. Different from classical AQP approaches, generative models allow us to compute responses to ad-hoc queries and deliver high-quality estimates also over rare subpopulations at the same time. In our experiments with real and synthetic data sets, we show that Model-based AQP can in many scenarios return more accurate results in a shorter runtime. Furthermore, we think that our techniques of using generative models presented in this paper can not only be used for AQP in databases but also has applications for other database problems including Query Optimization as well as Data Cleaning.},

We ran different choices through this analysis using a Universal Sentence Encoder.

As a result, supervision from statisticians is usually needed to find the right model for the data. However, as domain experts do not necessarily have to be experts in statistics, we propose Automatic Bayesian Density Analysis (ABDA) to make density estimation accessible at large. ABDA automates the selection of adequate likelihood models from arbitrarily rich dictionaries while modeling their interactions via a deep latent structure adaptively learned from data as a sum-product network. ABDA casts uncertainty estimation at these local and global levels into a joint Bayesian inference problem, providing robust and yet tractable inference. Extensive empirical evidence shows that ABDA is a suitable tool for automatic exploratory analysis of heterogeneous tabular data, allowing for missing value estimation, statistical data type and likelihood discovery, anomaly detection and dependency structure mining, on top of providing accurate density estimation.},

Deep probabilistic programming languages (PPL) are a powerful tool to ease the development of probabilistic models. They let users specify generative probabilistic models as programs and then ``compile'' those models down into inference procedures. Since probabilistic inference is still intractable, existing deep PPLs leverage deep learning for inference. The key idea is to describe inference via a second model called an inference model trained in variational fashion. Both the generative and the inference models can include deep neural networks as components. While the details of the employed neural architectures may differ, they typically model distributions only implicitly, i.e., they allow for sampling but not the computation of marginal probabilities. This extended abstract makes the case to not "go down the full neural road", but to explicitly obtain uncertainties in an arithmetic circuit manner. To this end, sum-product networks (SPNs) are a promising option, as they are a class of probabilistic model which permit explicit uncertainties and efficient inference. More precisely, SPNs can compute any marginalization and conditioning query in time linear of the model's representation size. Although SPNs can be described in a nutshell as "deep mixture models", they have received no attention in the deep PPL community, despite their attractive inference properties.},

To overcome this, we propose to extend density estimation to Automatic Bayesian Density Analysis (ABDA), casting both data modeling and selection of adequate likelihood models (statistical data types) into a joint inference problem. Specifically, we advocate a hierarchically structured mixture model, which explicitly incorporates arbitrarily rich collections of likelihood models and corresponding latent selection variables, and captures variable interactions by a latent hierarchical structure obtained from data-type agnostic structure learning. To account for prediction uncertainty, selection of parametric likelihood models and statistical data types, we employ Bayesian inference over a model formulated as a sum-product network, naturally providing the aforementioned expressiveness and flexibility, while facilitating exact and tractable inference.},

		The advent of industry 4.0 and the availability of large data storage systems lead to an increasing demand for specially educated data-oriented professionals in industrial production. The education of such specialists is supposed to combine elements from the three fields of engineering, data analysis and data administration. Data administration skills are demanded to handle big data in diverse storage structures in data bases. In order to extract knowledge from the stored data the proficient handling of data analysis tools - especially machine learning - is essential. Finally, industrial domain knowledge is important to identify possible applications for machine learning algorithms (and to interpret the results). However, to the best knowledge of the authors, an education program incorporating elements of all three fields has not yet been established (in Germany).

		In the context of the newly acquired project "Industrial Data Science" (InDaS) we aim to develop a qualification concept for machine learning in industrial production targeted at two different groups. On the one hand advanced students from any of the three fields mentioned above and on the other hand experienced professionals working in industrial production. For the first group a one term lecture is going to be designed while coping with different levels of knowledge in the inhomogeneous audience. It will be followed by a seminar with focus on use cases delivered by partners from industrial production. Separately a workshop concept for the second target group will be developed taking into account the strong domain knowledge of the participants.

		The contents of the qualification concept should be selected according to the needs of industrial companies. Therefore a survey was created to inquire the use and potentials of machine learning and the requirements for future employees in industrial production. The evaluation of the survey and the resulting conclusions affecting the qualification concept are going to be presented in this talk.

Problems ranging over probabilistic inference, planning, game theory, and numerical optimization have been tackled successfully using WMC technology. Weighted model integration (WMI) is a recent formalism generalizing WMC to the integration of functions over models of mixed discrete-continuous theories. WMI has already shown tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic programs. Yet, state of the art tools for WMI are nowhere as versatile as those for WMC--solvers are generally limited either by the range of amenable theories, or in terms of performance. Moreover, the data structures to represent, compose, and transform formulas over mixed theories have not reached the efficiency of their Boolean counterparts. Arguably, the latter is one of the prime reasons why WMC is so widely applicable. To address both limitations, we propose the use of extended algebraic decision diagrams (XADDs) as a compilation language for WMI. Aside from tackling typical WMI problems XADDs also enable partial WMI yielding parametrized solutions. To overcome the main roadblock of XADDs---the computational cost of variable elimination---we formulate a novel and powerful exact symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm that unlike its predecessor is able to effectively cache partial computations and seamlessly handle Boolean, integer-valued, and real variables. Our empirical results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can lead to an exponential to linear computational reduction in the best case and that it exceeds or matches state-of-the-art WMI solvers in terms of performance.},

We propose a probabilistic logic approach for robot grasping, which improves grasping capabilities by leveraging semantic object parts. It provides the robot with semantic reasoning skills about the most likely object part to be grasped, given the task constraints and object properties, while also dealing with the uncertainty of visual perception and grasp planning. The probabilistic logic framework is task-dependent. It semantically reasons about pre-grasp configurations with respect to the intended task and employs object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent grasping points. The logic-based module receives data from a low-level module that extracts semantic objects parts, and sends information to the low-level grasp planner. These three modules define our probabilistic logic framework, which is able to perform robotic grasping in realistic kitchen-related scenarios.},

We propose the use of probabilistic context-free grammars to sequence a series of primitives to generate complex robot policies from a given library of primitives. The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However, the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the posteriors of the grammars given the observations.

To make this difficult task easier, we propose the first trainable probabilistic deep architecture for hybrid domains that features tractable queries. It is based on Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) with piecewise polynomial leave distributions together with novel nonparametric decomposition and conditioning steps using the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi Maximum Correlation Coefficient. This relieves the user from deciding a-priori the parametric form of the random variables but is still expressive enough to effectively approximate any continuous distribution and permits efficient learning and inference. Our empirical evidence shows that the architecture, called Mixed SPNs, can indeed capture complex distributions across a wide range of hybrid domains.},

Specifically, we prove that Gaussian DNs admit coresets of size independent of the size of the data set. Unfortunately, this does not extend to DNs over members of the exponential family in general. As we will prove, Poisson DNs do not admit small coresets. Despite this worst-case result, we will provide an argument why our coreset construction for DNs can still work well in practice on count data. To corroborate our theoretical results, we empirically evaluated the resulting Core DNs on real data sets. The results demonstrate significant gains over no or naive sub-sampling, even in the case of count data.},

Understanding functional relationships of these biological processes is essential for developing new treatment strategies. However, most of the present techniques (in vitro or in vivo) include invasive microscopic or analytical tissue sampling. In the present study, a non-invasive alternative for monitoring processes during wound healing is introduced. Within this context, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging and innovative non-invasive imaging technique with different opportunities in medical applications. HSI acquires the spectral reflectance of an object, depending on its biochemical and structural characteristics. For analysing the complex hyperspectral data, an efficient unsupervised approach for clustering massive hyperspectral data was designed, based on efficient hierarchical decomposition of spectral information according to archetypal data points. It represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an advanced Data Mining approach in context of non-invasive analysis of wounds using hyperspectral imagery.},

Here we propose to start exploring the space between local and global graph kernels, striking the balance between both worlds. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph kernel based on the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, and show that it takes local as well as global properties into account. Unfortunately, the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm scales exponentially in k. Consequently, we devise a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation guarantees using conditional Rademacher averages. On bounded degree graphs, it can even be computed in constant time.

A microscope with a hyperspectral camera was used to study interactions between Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei and barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes with high susceptibility or resistance due to hypersensitive response (HR) and papilla formation. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of pathogen development was used to explain changes in hyperspectral signatures. Within 48 hours after inoculation, genotype specific changes in the green and red range (500-690 nm) and a blue shift of the red edge inflection point were observed. Manual analysis indicated resistance-specific reflectance patterns from one to three days after inoculation. These changes could be linked to host plant modifications depending on individual host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Retrospective analysis of hyperspectral images revealed spectral characteristics of HR against B. graminis f. sp. hordei. For early HR detection, an advanced data mining approach localized HR spots before they became visible on the RGB images derived from hyperspectral imaging. The link among processes during pathogenesis and host resistance to changes in hyperspectral signatures, provide evidence that sensor based phenotyping is suitable to advance time-consuming and cost-expensive visual rating of plant disease resistances.},

Therefore, in the second step, we interpret these rules as the input for approaches to structured argumentation.

In this paper we present a novel Poisson graphical model, the first based on sum product networks, called PSPN, allowing for positive as well as negative dependencies. We present algorithms for learning tree PSPNs from data as well as for tractable inference via symbolic evaluation. With these, information-theoretic measures such as entropy, mutual information, and distances among count variables can be computed without resorting to approximations. Additionally, we show a connection between PSPNs and LDA, linking the structure of tree PSPNs to a hierarchy of topics. The experimental results on several synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that PSPN often outperform state-of-the-art while remaining tractable.},

Instead, we propose an online nonparametric Bayesian method OLAD for anomaly detection in streaming time series collected continuously.

It can be seen as an assembly language for hard combinatorial problems ranging from classification and regression in learning, to computing optimal policies and equilibria in decision theory, to entropy minimization in information sciences. Unfortunately, specifying such problems in complex domains involving relations, objects and other logical dependencies is cumbersome at best, requiring considerable expert knowledge, and solvers require models to be painstakingly reduced to standard forms. To overcome this, we introduce a rich modeling framework for optimization problems that allows convenient codification of symbolic structure. Rather than reducing this symbolic structure to a sparse or dense matrix, we represent and exploit it directly using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Combining efficient ADD-based matrix-vector algebra with a matrix-free interior-point method, we develop an engine that can fully leverage the structure of symbolic representations to solve convex linear and quadratic optimization problems. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.},

These lifted QPs can then be tackled with the usual optimization toolbox (off-the-shelf solvers, cutting plane algorithms, stochastic gradients etc.).

The resulting novel graph kernels are shown to be, both, able to handle graphs with continuous attributes and scalable to large graphs and data sets.

The findings and interpretation of the NMF results were confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation of the layered alloy system. Furthermore, it is shown how the simultaneous factorization of several stacks of elemental distribution images provides uniform basis vectors and consequently simplifies the interpretation of the representation.},

The temporal and spatial development of CLS lesions on the two genotypes were monitored using a hyperspectral microscope. The lesion development on the QTL-carrying, resistant genotype was characterised by a fast and abrupt change in spectral reflectance, whereas it was slower and ultimately more severe on the genotype lacking the QTL. An efficient approach for clustering of hyperspectral signatures was adapted in order to reveal resistance characteristics automatically. The presented method allowed a fast and reliable differentiation of CLS dynamics and lesion composition providing a promising tool to improve resistance breeding by objective and precise plant phenotyping.},

Many successful approaches alleviate this problem by employing some form of distant supervision, i.e., look into knowledge bases such as Freebase as a source of supervision to create more examples. While this is perfectly reasonable, most distant supervision methods rely on a hand-coded background knowledge that explicitly looks for patterns in text. For example, they assume all sentences containing Person X and Person Y are positive examples of the relation married(X, Y). In this work, we take a different approach -- we infer weakly supervised examples for relations from models learned by using knowledge outside the natural language task. We argue that this method creates more robust examples that are particularly useful when learning the entire information-extraction model (the structure and parameters). We demonstrate on three domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to using distant supervision labels or a smaller set of gold-standard labels.},

A relational linear program (RLP) is a declarative LP template defining the objective and the constraints through the logical concepts of objects, relations, and quantified variables. This allows one to express the LP objective and constraints relationally for a varying number of individuals and relations among them without enumerating them. Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logical program consisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP. This ground LP is solved using lifted linear programming. That is, symmetries within the ground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the reduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. In contrast to mainstream LP template languages like AMPL, which features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a more intuitive representation of optimization problems over relational domains. We illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in Markov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision processes, and on collective inference using LP support vector machines.},

This has two benefits. First, off-the-shelf propagation schemes can be used to naturally construct kernels for many graph types, including labeled, partially labeled, unlabeled, directed, and attributed graphs. Second, by leveraging existing efficient and informative propagation schemes, propagation kernels can be considerably faster than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing predictive performance. We will also show that if the graphs at hand have a regular structure, for instance when modeling image or video data, one can exploit this regularity to scale the kernel computation to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes.

Specifically, we introduce a new probabilistic logic module to first semantically reason about pre-grasp configurations with respect to the intended tasks. Further, a mapping is learned from part-related visual features to good grasping points. The probabilistic logic module makes use of object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent grasping points.

However, obtaining symmetry derived from automorphism is GI-hard, and consequently only a small fraction of the symmetry is easily available for effective employment. In this paper, we improve upon efficiency in two ways. First, we introduce the Cluster Signature Graph (CSG), a platform on which greater portions of the symmetries can be revealed and exploited. CSGs classify clusters of variables by projecting relations between cluster members onto a graph, allowing for the efficient pruning of symmetrical clusters even before their generation. Second, we introduce a novel framework based on CSGs for the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear program (LP) relaxations, dedicated to exploiting this symmetry for the benefit of tight Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approximations. Combined with the pruning power of CSG, the framework quickly generates compact formulations for otherwise intractable LPs, as demonstrated by several empirical results.},

Here, we show that privileged information can naturally be treated as noise in the latent function of a Gaussian process classifier (GPC). That is, in contrast to the standard GPC setting, the latent function is not just a nuisance but a feature: it becomes a natural measure of confidence about the training data by modulating the slope of the GPC probit likelihood function. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed GPC method using privileged noise, called GPC+, improves over a standard GPC without privileged knowledge, and also over the current state-of-the-art SVM-based method, SVM+. Moreover, we show that advanced neural networks and deep learning methods can be compressed as privileged information.},

Here, we demonstrate that the reliance on modified MP can be eliminated for the class of MP algorithms arising from MAP-LP relaxations of pairwise MRFs. Specifically, we show that a given MRF induces a whole family of MRFs of different sizes sharing essentially the same MAPLP solution.

Churn in games is discussed and thoroughly defined as a formal problem, aligning with industry standards. Furthermore, a range of features which are generic to games are defined and evaluated for their usefulness in predicting player churn, e.g. playtime, session length and session intervals. Using these behavioral features, combined with the individual retention model for each game in the dataset used, we develop a broadly applicable churn prediction model, which does not rely on gamedesign specific features. The presented classifiers are applied on a dataset covering five free-to-play games resulting in high accuracy churn prediction.},

We give a sufficient condition for R-convolution kernels that enables kernel computation by explicit mapping. We theoretically and experimentally analyze efficiency and flexibility of implicit kernel functions and dot products of explicitly computed feature maps for widely used graph kernels such as random walk kernels, sub graph matching kernels, and shortest-path kernels. For walk kernels we observe a phase transition when comparing runtime with respect to label diversity and walk lengths leading to the conclusion that explicit computations are only favourable for smaller label sets and walk lengths whereas implicit computation is superior for longer walk lengths and data sets with larger label diversity.},

Recently, the automorphism group has been proposed to formalize mathematically what exploiting symmetry means. However, obtaining symmetry derived from automorphism is GI-hard, and consequently only a small fraction of the symmetry is easily available for effective employment. In this paper, we improve upon efficiency in two ways. First, we introduce the Cluster Signature Graph (CSG), a platform on which greater portions of the symmetries can be revealed and exploited. CSGs classify clusters of variables by projecting relations between cluster members onto a graph, allowing for the efficient pruning of symmetrical clusters even before their generation. Second, we introduce a novel framework based on CSGs for the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear program (LP) relaxations, dedicated to exploiting this symmetry for the benefit of tight Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approximations. Combined with the pruning power of CSG, the framework quickly generates compact formulations for otherwise intractable LPs, as demonstrated by several empirical results.},

One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers.

For instance, we show that the science job market can be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not memoryless but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to make k>1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that migration at later career stages is memoryless. This aligns well but actually goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education and research worldwide.},

Today's datasets from longitudinal studies offer great promise to uncover these interactions but also pose enormous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with potential long-range interactions over time.

Innovative sensor systems can provide detailed and highly resolved information on crop canopies and single plants in the visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared range (400 to 2500 nm). The interpretation and analysis of the complex and high dimensional hyperspectral data is challenging. Powerful and disease-specific analysis methods have to be developed for a successful evaluation of diseased plants by hyperspectral sensors. Based on the model system barley and the foliar diseases net blotch (caused by Pyrenophora teres), leaf rust (due to Puccinia hordei) and powdery mildew (due to Blumeria graminis hordei) full range spectral signatures of infected leaves were recorded using hyperspectral VIS/NIR and SWIR cameras. Spectral data cubes were analysed by extracting specific spectral signatures of disease symptoms during pathogenesis. Spectral patterns were observed with high resolution in time and space. Advanced data mining methods were used for the differentiation and quantification of diseased leaf tissue. An effective and automatic image analysis approach has been established by now. In a next step the models will be extended to other crops and their diseases.},

The plant reactions to drought stress result in spatial, temporal and tissue-specific pattern changes which can be detected using non-invasive sensor techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging. The ``response turning time-point'' in the temporal curve of plant response to stress rather than the maxima is the most relevant time-point for guided sampling to get insights into mechanistic basis of plant response to drought stress. Comparative hyperspectral image analysis was performed on barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants grown under well-watered and water stress conditions in two consecutive years. The obtained massive, high-dimensional data cubes were analysed with a recent matrix factorization technique based on simplex volume maximization of hyperspectral data and compared to several drought-related traits. The results show that it was possible to detect and visualize the accelerated senescence signature in stressed plants earlier than symptoms become visible by the naked eye.},

Typical ways to address this scaling issue are inference by approximate message passing, stochastic gradients, and MapReduce, among others. Often, we encounter inference and training problems with symmetries and redundancies in the graph structure. It has been shown that inference and training can indeed benefit from exploiting symmetries, for example by lifting loopy belief propagation (LBP).That is, a model is compressed by grouping nodes together that send and receive identical messages so that a modified LBP running on the lifted graph yields the same marginals as LBP on the original one, but often in a fraction of time.

While this is perfectly reasonable, most distant supervision methods rely on a hand coded background knowledge that explicitly looks for patterns in text. In this work, we take a different approach -- we create weakly supervised examples for relations by using commonsense knowledge. The key innovation is that this commonsense knowledge is completely independent of the natural language text. This helps when learning the full model for information extraction as against simply learning the parameters of a known CRF or MLN. We demonstrate on two domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to simply using the gold standard labels.},

We report on how users tag and rate photos and present an approach towards automatically recognizing the aesthetic appeal of images using confidence-based classifiers to alleviate effects due to ambiguously labeled data. Our results indicate that user generated content allows for learning about aesthetic appeal. In particular, established low-level image features seem to enable the recognition of beauty.

Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents. Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

	note         = {Early stress recognition is of great relevance in precision plant protection. Pre-symptomatic water stress detection is of particular interest, ultimately helping to meet the challenge of ``How to feed a hungry world?''. Due to the climate change, this is of considerable political and public interest. Due to its large-scale and temporal nature, e.g., when monitoring plants using hyper-spectral imaging, and the demand of physical meaning of the results, it presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability. However, big data matrices over time also arise in several other real-life applications such as stock market monitoring where a business sector is characterized by the ups and downs of each of its companies per year or topic monitoring of document collections. Therefore, we consider the general problem of embedding data matrices into Euclidean space over time without making any assumption on the generating distribution of each matrix. To do so, we represent all data samples by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time. On the simplex spanned by the extremes, there are then natural candidates for distributions inducing distances between and in turn embeddings of the data matrices. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic, text, and financial data as well as a large-scale dataset on water stress detection in plants with more than 3 billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that the embeddings are meaningful and fast to compute. The stress detection results were validated by a domain expert and conform to existing plant physiological knowledge.

	note         = {Low-rank approximations which are computed from selected rows and columns of a given data matrix have attracted considerable attention lately. They have been proposed as an alternative to the SVD because they naturally lead to interpretable decompositions which was shown to be successful in application such as fraud detection, fMRI segmentation, and collaborative filtering. The CUR decomposition of large matrices, for example, samples rows and columns according to a probability distribution that depends on the Euclidean norm of rows or columns or on other measures of statistical leverage. At the same time, there are various deterministic approaches that do not resort to sampling and were found to often yield factorization of superior quality with respect to reconstruction accuracy. However, these are hardly applicable to large matrices as they typically suffer from high computational costs. Consequently, many practitioners in the field of data mining have abandon deterministic approaches in favor of randomized ones when dealing with today's large-scale data sets. In this paper, we empirically disprove this prejudice. We do so by introducing a novel, linear-time, deterministic CUR approach that adopts the recently introduced Simplex Volume Maximization approach for column selection. The latter has already been proven to be successful for NMF-like decompositions of matrices of billions of entries. Our exhaustive empirical study on more than 30 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrates that it is also beneficial for CUR-like decompositions. Compared to other deterministic CUR-like methods, it provides comparable reconstruction quality but operates much faster so that it easily scales to matrices of billions of elements. Compared to sampling-based methods, it provides competitive reconstruction quality while staying in the same run-time complexity class.},

In this paper we propose Dirichlet-aggregation regression (DAR) to meet the challenge. DAR represents all data by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time and easy to interpret.Then, it puts a Gaussian process prior on the Dirichlet distributions induced on the simplex spanned by the extremes. The prior can be a function of any observed meta feature such as time, location, type of fertilization, and plant species. We evaluated DAR on two hyperspectral image series of plants over time with about 2 (resp. 5.8) Billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that DAR can be learned efficiently and predicts stress well before it becomes visible to the human eye.},

In order to effciently extract graph features from continuous node label distributions, and in general from continuous vector-valued node attributes, we utilize randomized techniques, which easily allow for deriving similarity measures based on propagated information. We show that propagation kernels utilizing locality-sensitive hashing reduce the runtime of existing graph kernels by several orders of magnitude.

When applied to game telemetry data, pattern recognition and statistical analysis provide valuable business intelligence tools for game development. An important problem in this area is to characterize how player engagement in a game evolves over time. Reliable models are of pivotal interest since they allow for assessing the long-term success of game products and can provide estimates of how long players may be expected to keep actively playing a game. In this paper, we introduce methods from random process theory into game data mining in order to draw inferences about player engagement. Given large samples (over 250,000 players) of behavioral telemetry data from five different action-adventure and shooter games, we extract information as to how long individual players have played these games and apply techniques from lifetime analysis to identify common patterns. In all five cases, we find that the Weibull distribution gives a good account of the statistics of total playing times. This implies that an average player's interest in playing one of the games considered evolves according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Therefore, given data on the initial playtime behavior of the players of a game, it becomes possible to predict when they stop playing.},

An appealing idea for such situations is to train and recombine local models. This breaks long-range dependencies and allows to exploit lifting within and across the local training tasks. Moreover, it naturally paves the way for online training for relational models. Specifically, we develop the first lifted stochastic gradient optimization method with gain vector adaptation, which processes each lifted piece one after the other.

Our key insight is that while there may be an infinite number of observations, there are only a finite number of continuous observation partitionings that are relevant for optimal decision-making when a finite, fixed set of reachable belief states is considered. To this end, we make two important contributions: (1) we show how previous exact symbolic dynamic programming solutions for continuous state MDPs can be generalized to continuous state POMDPs with discrete observations, and (2) we show how recently developed symbolic integration methods allow this solution to be extended to PBVI for continuous state and observation POMDPs with potentially correlated, multivariate continuous observation spaces.},

For proportional data (normalized histograms), this is not the case. Due to the sum-to-unity constraint, features that are as independent as possible will not all be uncorrelated. In this paper, we show that a linear-time transformation efficiently copes with sum-to-unity constraints: first, we select a small number K of diverse data points by maximizing the volume of the simplex spanned by these prototypes; second, we represent each data point by means of its cosine similarities to the K selected prototypes. This maximum volume hashing is sensible since each dimension in the transformed space is likely to follow a von Mises (vM) distribution, and, in very high dimensions, the vM distribution closely resembles a Gaussian distribution. This justifies to employ PCA on the transformed data. Our extensive experiments validate this: maximum volume hashing outperforms spectral hashing and other state of the art techniques.},

Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

Utilizing localitysensitive hashing, propagation kernels are able to outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels in terms of runtime without loss in prediction accuracy. This paper investigates the power of propagation kernels to classify partially labeled images and to tackle the challenging problem of retrieving similar object views in robotic grasping},

Whereas current learning approaches for RDNs learn a single probability tree per random variable, we propose to turn the problem into a series of relational function-approximation problems using gradient-based boosting. In doing so, one can easily induce highly complex features over several iterations and in turn estimate quickly a very expressive model.

Classical supervised learning algorithms often fail in applied plant sciences due to their need of labelled datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Therefore, new approaches for unsupervised learning of relevant patterns are needed. We apply for the first time a recent matrix factorisation technique, simplex volume maximisation (SiVM), to hyperspectral data. It is an unsupervised classification approach, optimised for fast computation of massive datasets. It allows calculation of how similar each spectrum is to observed typical spectra. This provides the means to express how likely it is that one plant is suffering from stress. The method was tested for drought stress, applied to potted barley plants in a controlled rain-out shelter experiment and to agricultural corn plots subjected to a two factorial field setup altering water and nutrient availability. Both experiments were conducted on the canopy level. SiVM was significantly better than using a combination of established vegetation indices. In the corn plots, SiVM clearly separated the different treatments, even though the effects on leaf and canopy traits were subtle.},

We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E3 and R-MAX algorithms. Efficient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efficiency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efficient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.},

Recently, efficient algorithms were presented for updating the structure of an existing lifted network with incremental changes to the evidence. In the inference stage, however, current algorithms need to construct a separate lifted network for each evidence case and run a modified message passing algorithm on each lifted network separately. Consequently, symmetries across the inference tasks are not exploited. In this paper, we present a novel lifted message passing technique that exploits symmetries across multiple evidence cases. The benefits of this multi-evidence lifted inference are shown for several important AI tasks such as computing personalized PageRanks and Kalman filters via multievidence lifted Gaussian belief propagation.},

More precisely, we justify to sample documents randomly biased towards those ones with higher norms to form mini-batches.

Although, a very first link between both fields has been established already in the early 90ies, many recent papers on mobility mining seem to be unaware of it. We therefore revisit the link and show that many unexplored and novel mobility mining methods fall naturally out of it. Specifically, using advanced discretization techniques for stay-point detection and map matching, we turn traffic sequences into a biological ones. Then, we introduce a novel distance function that enables us to directly apply the rich toolbox for biological sequence analysis to it. For instance, by just looking at co mplex traffic data through the biological glasses of sequence logos we get a novel, easy-to-grasp visualization of data, called Traffic Logos.

Then, we find paths of atoms that are connected via their arguments, variablize the ground atoms in each path, in order to create features for the query.

Moreover, we exploit that RWR techniques can naturally be lifted and show that lifted inference for label propagation is possible.

A popular solution in these cases is the idea of turning the complex inference task into a sequence of simpler ones by selecting and clamping variables one at a time and running lifted message passing again after each selection. This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference.

For propositional worlds, functional gradient methods have been proved to be beneficial. They are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient, more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the form of the function. Building on recent generalizations of functional gradient boosting to relational representations, we implement a functional gradient boosting approach to imitation learning in relational domains. In particular, given a set of traces from the human teacher, our system learns a policy in the form of a set of relational regression trees that additively approximate the functional gradients. The use of multiple additive trees combined with relational representation allows for learning more expressive policies than what has been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in several different domains.},

	note         = {Recent years have seen a surge of interest in Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) models that combine logic with probabilities. One prominent example is Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). While MLNs are indeed highly expressive, this expressiveness comes at a cost. Learning MLNs is a hard problem and therefore has attracted much interest in the SRL community. Current methods for learning MLNs follow a twostep approach: first, perform a search through the space of possible clauses and then learn appropriate weights for these clauses. We propose to take a different approach, namely to learn both the weights and the structure of the MLN simultaneously. Our approach is based on functional gradient boosting where the problem of learning MLNs is turned into a series of relational functional approximation problems. We use two kinds of representations for the gradients: clausebased and tree-based. Our experimental evaluation on several benchmark data sets demonstrates that our new approach can learn MLNs as good or better than those found with state-ofthe-art methods, but often in a fraction of the time.},

In the inference stage, however, current algorithms need to construct a separate lifted network for each evidence case and run a modified message passing algorithm on each lifted network separately. Consequently, symmetries across the inference tasks are not exploited. In this paper, we present a novel lifted message passing technique that exploits symmetries across multiple evidence cases. The benefits of this multi-evidence lifted inference are shown for several important AI tasks such as solving linear programs, computing personalized PageRanks and Kalman filters via multi-evidence lifted Gaussian belief propagation.},

	note         = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

Previous work has developed a set of operations for composition and for removing redundancies in FODDs, thus keeping them compact, and showed how to successfully employ FODDs for solving large-scale stochastic planning problems through the formalism of relational Markov decision processes (RMDP). In this paper, we introduce several new ideas enhancing the applicability of FODDs. More specifically, we first introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and composition operations for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we develop a novel approach for reducing (G)FODDs using model checking. This yields -- for the first time -- a reduction that maximally reduces the diagram for the FODD case and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs. Finally we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a complete solution for the case where the reward function is specified using an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers.},

In this work, we show that it is also possible to exploit the full expressive power of first-order quantification to achieve state, action, and observation abstraction in a dynamic programming solution to relationally specified POMDPs. Among the advantages of this approach are the ability to maintain compact value function representations, abstract over the space of potentially optimal actions, and automatically derive compact conditional policy trees that minimally partition relational observation spaces according to distinctions that have an impact on policy values. This is the first lifted relational POMDP solution that can optimally accommodate actions with a potentially infinite relational space of observation outcomes.},

We demonstrate this idea by introducing novel model-checking reduction operations for First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a representation that has been used to implement decision-theoretic planning with Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP). Intuitively, these reductions modify the construction of the value function by removing any complex specifications that are irrelevant to the set of training examples, thereby focusing on the region of interest. We show that such training examples can be constructed on the fly from a description of the planning problem thus we can bootstrap to get a self-taught planning system. Additionally, we provide a new heuristic to embed universal and conjunctive goals within the framework of RMDP planners, expanding the scope and applicability of such systems. We show that these ideas lead to significant improvements in performance in terms of both speed and coverage of the planner, yielding state of the art planning performance on problems from the International Planning Competition.},

While this certainly has its advantages, arguably, a more flexible and intuitive way would be to sort images into arbitrary structures such as grids, hierarchies, or spheres so that images that are visually or semantically alike are placed together. This paper focuses on designing such a navigation system for image browsers. This is a challenging task because arbitrary layout structure makes it difficult -- if not impossible -- to compute cross-similarities between images and structure coordinates, the main ingredient of traditional layouting approaches. For this reason, we resort to a recently developed machine learning technique: kernelized sorting. It is a general technique for matching pairs of objects from different domains without requiring cross-domain similarity measures and hence elegantly allows sorting images into arbitrary structures. Moreover, we extend it so that some images can be preselected for instance forming the tip of the hierarchy allowing to subsequently navigate through the search results in the lower levels in an intuitive way.},

While it was already shown that active learning can effectively reduce the number of training pairs needed, the most successful existing algorithms cannot generalize over items or queries. Considering web search as an example, they would need to learn a separate relevance score for each document-query pair from scratch. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose a link-based active preference learning method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) that incorporates dependency information from both feature-vector representations as well as relations. Specifically, to meet the requirement on computational efficiency of active exploration, we introduce a novel incremental update method that scales as well as the non-generalizing models.

However, actually carrying this out requires highly efficient ways of (1) storing millions of scan points in memory and (2) quickly finding similar scan points to a target scan point. In this paper, we propose to address both issues by employing Weiss et al.'s recent spectral hashing. It represents each item in a database by a compact binary code that is constructed so that similar items will have similar binary code words. In turn, similar neighbors have codes within a small Hamming distance of the code for the query. Then, we learn a logistic regression model locally over all points with the same binary code word. Our experiments on real world 3D scans show that the resulting approach, called spectrally hashed logistic regression, can be ultra fast at prediction time and outperforms state-of-the art approaches such as logistic regression and nearest neighbor.},

CH-NMF factorizes a non-negative data matrix V into two nonnegative matrix factors V ≈ W H such that the columns of W are convex combinations of certain data points so that they are readily interpretable to data analysts. There is, however, no free lunch: imposing convexity constraints on W typically prevents adaptation to intrinsic, low dimensional structures in the data. Alas, in cases where the data is distributed in a non-convex manner or consists of mixtures of lower dimensional convex distributions, the cluster representatives obtained from CH-NMF will be less meaningful. In this paper, we present a hierarchical CH-NMF that automatically adapts to internal structures of a dataset, hence it yields meaningful and interpretable clusters for non-convex datasets. This is also confirmed by our extensive evaluation on DBLP publication records of 760,000 authors, 4,000,000 images harvested from the web, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft guilds.},

Surprisingly, kernel methods have not received attention yet although they are very popular in the machine learning community due to their solid mathematical foundation, tendency toward easy geometric interpretation, and strong empirical performance in a wide variety of domains. In this paper, we show how to employ kernels for map matching. Specifically, ignoring map constraints, we first maximize the consistency between the similarity measures captured by the kernel matrices of the trajectory and relevant part of the street map. The resulting relaxed assignment is then ''rounded'' into a hard assignment fulfilling the map constraints. On synthetic and real-world trajectories, we show that kernels methods can be used for map matching and perform well compared to probabilistic methods such as HMMs.},

Recently, lifted belief propagation (LBP) has been proposed as an efficient approximate solution of this inference problem. It runs a modified BP on a lifted network where nodes have been grouped together if they have --- roughly speaking --- identical computation trees, the tree-structured unrolling of the underlying graph rooted at the nodes. In many situations, this purely syntactic criterion is too pessimistic: message errors decay along paths. Intuitively, for a long chain graph with weak edge potentials, distant nodes will send and receive identical messages yet their computation trees are quite different. To overcome this, we propose iLBP, a novel, easy-to-implement, informed LBP approach that interleaves lifting and modified BP iterations. In turn, we can efficiently monitor the true BP messages sent and received in each iteration and group nodes accordingly. As our experiments show, iLBP can yield significantly faster more lifted network while not degrading performance. Above all, we show that iLBP is faster than BP when solving the problem of distributing data to a large network, an important real-world application where BP is faster than uninformed LBP.},

Nevertheless, it can induce severe mechanical stress to the lung, which generally impairs the outcome of the therapy. To reduce the risk of a ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), lung protective ventilation is essential, especially for patients with a previous medical history like the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The prerequisite for lung protective ventilation approaches is the knowledge about the physical behavior of the human lung under the condition of mechanical ventilation. This knowledge is commonly described by mathematical models. Diverse models have been introduced to represent particular aspects of mechanical characteristics of the lung. A commonly accepted general model is the equation of motion, which relates the airway pressure to the airflow and the volume applied by the ventilator and describes the influence of the distensibility and resistance of the respiratory system. Equation Discovery systems extract mathematical models from observed time series data. To reduce the vast search space associated with this task, the LAGRAMGE-system introduced the application of declarative bias in Equation Discovery, which furthermore allows the presentation of domain specific knowledge. We introduce a modification of this system and apply it to data obtained during mechanical ventilation of ARDS-patients. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that the equation of motion model can automatically be rediscovered from real-world data.},

In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for the factorization of gigantic matrices that iteratively yields latent components. We consider a constrained matrix factorization s.t.~the latent components form a simplex that encloses most of the remaining data. The algorithm maximizes the volume of that simplex and thereby reduces the displacement of data from the space spanned by the latent components. Hence, it also lowers the Frobenius norm, a common criterion for matrix factorization quality. Our algorithm is efficient, well-grounded in distance geometry, and easily applicable to matrices with billions of entries. In addition, the resulting factors allow for an intuitive interpretation of data: every data point can now be expressed as a convex combination of the most extreme and thereby often most descriptive instances in a collection of data. Extensive experimental validations on web-scale data, including 80 million images and 1.5 million twitter tweets, demonstrate superior performance compared to related factorization or clustering techniques.},

In this paper we explore the modeling and analysis of complex social networks with IHRMs for community detection, link prediction and product recommendation. In an IHRM-based social network model, each edge is associated with a random variable and the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables are specified by the model, based on the relational structure. The hidden variables, one for each object, are able to transport information such that non-local probabilistic dependencies can be obtained. The model can be used to predict entity attributes, to predict relationships between entities and it performs an interpretable cluster analysis. We demonstrate the performance of IHRMs with three social network applications. We perform community analysis on the Sampson's monastery data and perform link analysis on the Bernard & Killworth data. Finally we apply IHRMs to the MovieLens data for prediction of user preference on movies and for an analysis of user clusters and movie clusters.},

Then it runs a modified BP algorithm on the compressed graph that is equivalent to running BP on the original factor graph.

A crucial ingredient of this scheme is a set of operations to remove redundancy in decision diagrams, thus keeping them compact. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and combination algorithms for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a particularly promising case where an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers is followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers. Third, we develop a new approach to reduce FODDs and GFODDs using model checking. This yields a reduction that is complete for FODDs and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs.},

It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

In this paper, we show how to estimate these quantile functions within a Bayes risk minimization framework using a Gaussian process prior. The resulting non-parametric probabilistic model is easy to implement and allows non-crossing quantile functions to be enforced. Moreover, it can directly be used in combination with tools and extensions of standard Gaussian Processes such as principled hyperparameter estimation, sparsification, and quantile regression with input-dependent noise rates. No existing approach enjoys all of these desirable properties. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.},

Specifically, we propose stacked Gaussian process learning, a meta-learning scheme in which a base Gaus- sian process is enhanced by adding the posterior covariance functions of other related tasks to its covariance function in a stage-wise optimization. The idea is that the stacked posterior covariances encode the hidden common causes among variables of interest that are shared across the related regression tasks. Stacked Gaussian process learning is efficient, capable of capturing shared common causes, and can be implemented with any kind of standard Gaussian process regression model such as sparse approximations and relational variants. Our experimental results on real-world data from the market relevant application show that stacked Gaussian processes learning can significantly improve prediction performance of a standard Gaussian process.},

The key idea is to apply Friedmann's gradient boosting: policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models grown in an stage-wise optimization.

Relational sequence alignment aims at exploiting symbolic structure to avoid the full enumeration. This comes at the expense of a more complex reward model selection problem: virtually infinitely many abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we apply gradientbased boosting to leverage this problem. Specifically, we show how to reduce the learning problem to a series of relational regressions problems. The main benefit of this is that interactions between states variables are introduced only as needed, so that the potentially infinite search space is not explicitly considered.

In this work we develop a representation that naturally combines the power of both relational and hierarchical models in the form of Logical Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (LoHiHMMs). LoHiHMMs inherit the compactness of representation from Logical HMMs and the tractability of inference from Hierarchical HMMs. We outline two inference algorithms: one based on grounding the LoHiHMM to a propositional HMM and the other based on particle filtering adapted for this setting.

Each random variable drawn from a GP represents profile/preference of an entity in some aspect, which is the function value of entity features at the aspect. These GPs are then coupled together via relations between entities. The MRGP model can be used for relation prediction and (semi-) supervised learning.

In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic measurement model for range finders, called Gaussian beam processes, which treats the measurement modeling task as a nonparametric Bayesian regression problem and solves it using Gaussian processes. The major benefit of our approach is its ability to generalize over entire range scans directly. This way, we can learn the distributions of range measurements for whole regions of the robot's configuration space from only few recorded or simulated range scans. Especially in approximative approaches to state estimation like particle filtering or histogram filtering, this leads to a better approximation of the true likelihood function.

We follow Goldberg et al.'s approach and model the noise variance using a second GP in addition to the GP governing the noise-free output value. In contrast to Goldberg et al., however, we do not use a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to approximate the posterior noise variance but a most likely noise approach. The resulting model is easy to implement and can directly be used in combination with various existing extensions of the standard GPs such as sparse approximations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, including a challenging perception problem in robotics, show the effectiveness of most likely heteroscedastic GP regression.},

They deal with logical sequences, i.e., sequences over an alphabet of logical atoms. This comes at the expense of a more complex model selection problem. Indeed, different abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel method for selecting logical hidden Markov models from data called SAGEM. SAGEM combines generalized expectation maximization, which optimizes parameters, with structure search for model selection using inductive logic programming refinement operators. We provide convergence and experimental results that show SAGEM's effectiveness.},

Global approaches (collective classification), on the other hand, exploit unlabeled data and the links occurring between labeled and unlabeled data for learning. Naturally, global approaches are computationally more demanding than local ones. Moreover, for large data sets, approximate inference has to be performed to make computations feasible. In the present work, we investigate the benefits of collective classification based on global probabilistic models over local approaches. Our experimental results show that global approaches do not always outperform local approaches with respect to the classification accuracy. More precisely, the results suggest that global approaches considerably outperform local approaches only for low ratios of labeled data.},

We defined two tasks: the first one was to recognize the measurement method producing a given pressure--volume curve. This was defined as the task of classifying pressure--volume curves (the classes being the measurement methods). The second was to model the curves themselves, that is, to predict the volume given the pressure, the measurement method and the patient data. Clearly, this can be defined as a regression task. For these two tasks, we applied C5.0 and CUBIST, two inductive machine learning tools, respectively. Apart from medical findings regarding the characteristics of the measurement methods, we found some evidence showing the value of an abstract representation for classifying curves: normalization and high-level descriptors from curve fitting played a crucial role in obtaining reasonably accurate models. Another useful feature of algorithms for inductive machine learning is the possibility of incorporating background knowledge. In our study, the incorporation of patient data helped to improve regression results dramatically, which might open the door for the individual respiratory treatment of patients in the future.},

Bayesian logic programs tightly integrate definite logic programs with Bayesian networks. The resulting framework nicely seperates the qualitative (i.e. logical) component from the quantitative (i.e. the probabilistic) one. We also show how the quantitative component can be learned using a gradient-based maximum likelihood method.},

In this paper, we present results on combining Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with Bayesian networks to learn both the qualitative and the quantitative components of Bayesian logic programs. More precisely, we show how to combine the ILP setting learning from interpretations with score-based techniques for learning Bayesian networks. Thus, the paper positively answers Koller and Pfeffer's question, whether techniques from ILP could help to learn the logical component of first order probabilistic models.},

We introduce the formalism of Bayesian logic programs, which is basically a simplification and reformulation of Ngo and Haddawys probabilistic logic programs. However, Bayesian logic programs are sufficiently powerful to represent essentially the same knowledge in a more elegant manner. The elegance is illustrated by the fact that they can represent both Bayesian nets and definite clause programs (as in pure Prolog) and that their kernel in Prolog is actually an adaptation of an usual Prolog meta-interpreter.},

By incorporating knowledge of second-order derivatives, the natural gradient prevents premature convergence. We will present benchmarks on the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) as a natural policy gradient algorithm and on Separable Natural Evolution Strategies (sNES) and compare results and implementations of these two algorithms. Our experience has shown that sNES performs better in most benchmarks while being easier to handle due to having less hyperparameters.},

Moreover, doing this in an unsupervised fashion requires human users to understand a model's learned concepts and potentially revise false concepts. In addressing this challenge, we introduce the Neural Concept Binder, a new framework for deriving discrete concept representations resulting in what we term "concept-slot encodings". These encodings leverage both "soft binding" via object-centric block-slot encodings and "hard binding" via retrieval-based inference. The Neural Concept Binder facilitates straightforward concept inspection and direct integration of external knowledge, such as human input or insights from other AI models like GPT-4. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the hard binding mechanism does not compromise performance; instead, it enables seamless integration into both neural and symbolic modules for intricate reasoning tasks, as evidenced by evaluations on our newly introduced CLEVR-Sudoku dataset.},

Foosball constitutes a versatile learning environment with the potential to yield cutting-edge research in various fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, notably robust learning, while also extending its applicability to industrial robotics and automation setups. To transform our physical Foosball table into a research-friendly system, we augmented it with a 2 degrees of freedom kinematic chain to control the goalkeeper rod as an initial setup with the intention to be extended to the full game as soon as possible. Our experiments reveal that a realistic simulation is essential for mastering complex robotic tasks, yet translating these accomplishments to the real system remains challenging, often accompanied by a performance decline. This emphasizes the critical importance of research in this direction. In this concern, we spotlight the automated Foosball table as an invaluable tool, possessing numerous desirable attributes, to serve as a demanding learning environment for advancing robotics and automation research.},
