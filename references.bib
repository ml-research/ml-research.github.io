  Note = {Backdoor attacks pose a serious security threat for training neural networks as they surreptitiously introduce hidden functionalities into a model. 
  Such backdoors remain silent during inference on clean inputs, evading detection due to inconspicuous behavior. However, once a specific trigger pattern appears in the input data, 
  the backdoor activates, causing the model to execute its concealed function. Detecting such poisoned samples within vast datasets is virtually impossible through manual inspection. 
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that enables model training on potentially poisoned datasets by utilizing the power of recent diffusion models. 
  Specifically, we create synthetic variations of all training samples, leveraging the inherent resilience of diffusion models to potential trigger patterns in the data. 
  By combining this generative approach with knowledge distillation, we produce student models that maintain their general performance on the task while exhibiting robust resistance to backdoor triggers.},

  Its implications for preserving model privacy, however, have remained unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigate the impact of label smoothing on model inversion attacks (MIAs), which aim to generate class-representative 
  samples by exploiting the knowledge encoded in a classifier, thereby inferring sensitive information about its training data. Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters MIAs, 
  thereby increasing a model’s privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, 
  beating state-of-the-art defenses. This establishes a practical and powerful novel way for enhancing model resilience against MIAs.},

  Journal = {Nature Machine Intelligence},
  Note = {As machine learning models become larger, and are increasingly trained on large and uncurated datasets in weakly supervised mode, it becomes important to establish mechanisms for inspecting, interacting with and revising models. These are necessary to mitigate shortcut learning effects and to guarantee that the model’s learned knowledge is aligned with human knowledge. Recently, several explanatory interactive machine learning methods have been developed for this purpose, but each has different motivations and methodological details. In this work, we provide a unification of various explanatory interactive machine learning methods into a single typology by establishing a common set of basic modules. We discuss benchmarks and other measures for evaluating the overall abilities of explanatory interactive machine learning methods. With this extensive toolbox, we systematically and quantitatively compare several explanatory interactive machine learning methods. In our evaluations, all methods are shown to improve machine learning models in terms of accuracy and explainability. However, we found remarkable differences in individual benchmark tasks, which reveal valuable application-relevant aspects for the integration of these benchmarks in the development of future methods.},

  Howpublished = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.08395},
  Note = {Artificial intelligence (AI) research has a long track record of drawing inspirations from findings from biology, in particular human intelligence. In contrast to current AI research that mainly treats explanations as a means for model inspection, a somewhat neglected finding from human psychology is the benefit of self-explaining in an agents' learning process. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel learning paradigm, termed Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX). The underlying idea is that a learning module (learner) performs a base task, e.g. image classification, and provides explanations to its decisions. An internal critic module next evaluates the quality of these explanations given the original task. Finally, the learner is refined with the critic's feedback and the loop is repeated as required. The intuition behind this is that an explanation is considered "good" if the critic can perform the same task given the respective explanation. Despite many implementation possibilities the structure of any LSX instantiation can be taxonomized based on four learning modules which we identify as: Fit, Explain, Reflect and Revise. In our work, we provide distinct instantiations of LSX for two different learner models, each illustrating different choices for the various LSX components. We broadly evaluate these on several datasets and show that Learning by Self-Explaining not only boosts the generalization abilities of AI models, particularly in small-data regimes, but also aids in mitigating the influence of confounding factors, as well as leading to more task specific and faithful model explanations. Overall, our results provide experimental evidence of the potential of self-explaining within the learning phase of an AI model.},

  author={David Steinmann and Wolfgang Stammer and Felix Friedrich and Kristian Kersting},
  Howpublished = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.13453},
  Note = {While traditional deep learning models often lack interpretability, concept bottleneck models (CBMs) provide inherent explanations via their concept representations. Specifically, they allow users to perform interventional interactions on these concepts by updating the concept values and thus correcting the predictive output of the model. Traditionally, however, these interventions are applied to the model only once and discarded afterward. To rectify this, we present concept bottleneck memory models (CB2M), an extension to CBMs. Specifically, a CB2M learns to generalize interventions to appropriate novel situations via a two-fold memory with which it can learn to detect mistakes and to reapply previous interventions. In this way, a CB2M learns to automatically improve model performance from a few initially obtained interventions. If no prior human interventions are available, a CB2M can detect potential mistakes of the CBM bottleneck and request targeted interventions. In our experimental evaluations on challenging scenarios like handling distribution shifts and confounded training data, we illustrate that CB2M are able to successfully generalize interventions to unseen data and can indeed identify wrongly inferred concepts. Overall, our results show that CB2M is a great tool for users to provide interactive feedback on CBMs, e.g., by guiding a user's interaction and requiring fewer interventions.},

note = {Neurally-parameterized Structural Causal Models in the Pearlian notion to causality, referred to as NCM, were recently introduced as a step towards next-generation learning systems. However, said NCM are only concerned with the learning aspect of causal inference and totally miss out on the architecture aspect. That is, actual causal inference within NCM is intractable in that the NCM won’t return an answer to a query in polynomial time. This insight follows as corollary to the more general statement on the intractability of arbitrary structural causal model (SCM) parameterizations, which we prove in this work through classical 3-SAT reduction. Since future learning algorithms will be required to deal with both high dimensional data and highly complex mechanisms governing the data, we ultimately believe work on tractable inference for causality to be decisive. We also show that not all “causal” models are created equal. More specifically, there are models capable of answering causal queries that are not SCM, which we refer to as partially causal models (PCM). We provide a tabular taxonomy in terms of tractability properties for all of the different model families, namely correlation-based, PCM and SCM. To conclude our work, we also provide some initial ideas on how to overcome parts of the intractability of causal inference with SCM by showing an example of how parameterizing an SCM with SPN modules can at least allow for tractable mechanisms. With this work we hope that our insights can raise awareness for this novel research direction since achieving success with causality in real world downstream tasks will not only depend on learning correct models but also require having the practical ability to gain access to
model inferences.},

note = {The recent years have been marked by extended research on adversarial attacks, especially on deep neural networks. With this work we intend on posing and investigating the question of whether the phenomenon might be more general in nature, that is, adversarial-style attacks outside classical classification tasks. Specifically, we investigate optimization problems as they constitute a fundamental part of modern AI research. To this end, we consider the base class of optimizers namely Linear Programs (LPs). On our initial attempt of a naïve mapping between the formalism of adversarial examples and LPs, we quickly identify the key ingredients missing for making sense of a reasonable notion of adversarial examples for LPs. Intriguingly, the formalism of Pearl's notion to causality allows for the right description of adversarial like examples for LPs. Characteristically, we show the direct influence of the Structural Causal Model (SCM) onto the subsequent LP optimization, which ultimately exposes a notion of confounding in LPs (inherited by said SCM) that allows for adversarial-style attacks. We provide both the general proof formally alongside existential proofs of such intriguing LP-parameterizations based on SCM for three combinatorial problems, namely Linear Assignment, Shortest Path and a real world problem of energy systems.},

note = {Deep neural learning has shown remarkable performance at learning representations for visual object categorization. However, deep neural networks such as CNNs do not explicitly encode objects and relations among them. This limits their success on tasks that require a deep logical understanding of visual scenes, such as Kandinsky patterns and Bongard problems. To overcome these limitations, we introduce 𝛼ILP, a novel differentiable inductive logic programming framework that learns to represent scenes as logic programs—intuitively, logical atoms correspond to objects, attributes, and relations, and clauses encode high-level scene information. 𝛼ILP has an end-to-end reasoning architecture from visual inputs. Using it, 𝛼ILP performs differentiable inductive logic programming on complex visual scenes, i.e., the logical rules are learned by gradient descent. Our extensive experiments on Kandinsky patterns and CLEVR-Hans benchmarks demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of 𝛼ILP in learning complex visual-logical concepts.},

SOTA DPPL approaches allow only for limited conditional probabilistic queries and do

SLASH, a novel DPPL that consists of Neural-Probabilistic Predicates (NPPs) and a logic
program, united via answer set programming (ASP). NPPs are a novel design principle
allowing for combining all deep model types and combinations thereof to be represented
as a single probabilistic predicate. In this context, we introduce a novel +/− notation
for answering various types of probabilistic queries by adjusting the atom notations of a
predicate. To scale well, we show how to prune the stochastically insignificant parts of the
(ground) program, speeding up reasoning without sacrificing the predictive performance.

As these systems grow in size, the number of variables and complexity of interactions between them does, too. Thus, becoming convoluted and difficult to analyze. This is particularly true in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence, where an ever increasing amount of data demands for new methods to simplify and compress large scale SCM. While methods for marginalizing and abstracting SCM already exist today, they may destroy the causality of the marginalized model. To alleviate this, we introduce the concept of consolidating causal mechanisms to transform large-scale SCM while preserving consistent interventional behaviour. We show consolidation is a powerful method for simplifying SCM, discuss reduction of computational complexity and give a perspective on generalizing abilities of consolidated SCM.}

  Note= {Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of additional memory since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This renders it difficult, if not impossible, to use explanations in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method relying on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics and models while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.}

NUDGE exploits trained neural network-based agents to guide the search of candidate-weighted logic rules, then uses differentiable logic to train the logic agents. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that NUDGE agents can induce interpretable and explainable policies while outperforming purely neural ones and showing good flexibility to environments of different initial states and problem sizes.}

  Note = {The limited priors required by neural networks make them the dominating choice to encode and learn policies using reinforcement learning (RL). However, they are also black-boxes, making it hard to understand the agent's behaviour, especially when working on the image level. Therefore, neuro-symbolic RL aims at creating policies that are interpretable in the first place. Unfortunately, interpretability is not explainability. To achieve both, we introduce Neurally gUided Differentiable loGic policiEs (NUDGE). NUDGE exploits trained neural network-based agents to guide the search of candidate-weighted logic rules, then uses differentiable logic to train the logic agents. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that NUDGE agents can induce interpretable and explainable policies while outperforming purely neural ones and showing good flexibility to environments of different initial states and problem sizes.}

  Note = {Visual reasoning is essential for building intelligent agents that understand the world and perform problem-solving beyond perception. Differentiable forward reasoning has been developed to integrate reasoning with gradient-based machine learning paradigms. However, due to the memory intensity, most existing approaches do not bring the best of the expressivity of first-order logic, excluding a crucial ability to solve abstract visual reasoning, where agents need to perform reasoning by using analogies on abstract concepts in different scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose NEUro-symbolic Message-pAssiNg reasoNer (NEUMANN), which is a graph-based differentiable forward reasoner, passing messages in a memory-efficient manner and handling structured programs with functors. Moreover, we propose a computationally-efficient structure learning algorithm to perform explanatory program induction on complex visual scenes. To evaluate, in addition to conventional visual reasoning tasks, we propose a new task, visual reasoning behind-the-scenes, where agents need to learn abstract programs and then answer queries by imagining scenes that are not observed. We empirically demonstrate that NEUMANN solves visual reasoning tasks efficiently, outperforming neural, symbolic, and neuro-symbolic baselines.}

  Note = {The predicates used for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems are usually elusive and need to be hand-crafted in advance, which limits the generalization of the system when learning new rules without sufficient background knowledge. Predicate Invention (PI) for ILP is the problem of discovering new concepts that describe hidden relationships in the domain. PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic ruless. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for NeSy ILP systems that can handle visual input to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is relatively unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neural-symbolic approach, NeSy-𝜋, to invent predicates from visual scenes for NeSy ILP systems based on clustering and extension of relational concepts. (𝜋 denotes the abbrivation of Predicate Invention). NeSy-𝜋 processes visual scenes as input using deep neural networks for the visual perception and invents new concepts that support the task of classifying complex visual scenes. The invented concepts can be used by any NeSy ILP systems instead of hand-crafted background knowledge. Our experiments show that the PI model is capable of inventing high-level concepts and solving complex visual logic patterns more efficiently and accurately in the absence of explicit background knowledge.Moreover, the invented concepts are explainable and interpretable, while also providing competitive results with state-of-the-art NeSy ILP systems based on given knowledge.},

To address this, we propose the visual logical learning dataset, V-LoL, that seamlessly combines visual and logical challenges. Notably, we introduce the first instantiation of V-LoL, V-LoL-Trains, – a visual rendition of a classic benchmark in symbolic AI, the Michalski train problem. By incorporating intricate visual scenes and flexible logical reasoning tasks within a versatile framework, V-LoL provides a platform for investigating a wide range of visual logical learning challenges. We evaluate a variety of AI systems including traditional symbolic AI, neural AI, as well as neuro-symbolic AI. Our evaluations demonstrate that even state-of-the-art AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations specific to each methodology.

In order to improve this alignment and reinforce commonsense reasons, we propose a tuning paradigm based on human interactions with machine generated data. Our ILLUME executes the following loop: Given an image-question-answer prompt, the VLM samples multiple candidate rationales, and a human critic provides minimal feedback via preference selection, used for fine-tuning. This loop increases the training data and gradually carves out the VLM's rationalization capabilities that are aligned with human intend. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that ILLUME is competitive with standard supervised fine-tuning while using significantly fewer training data and only requiring minimal feedback.},

In turn, they may even reinforce such biases. To help combat these undesired side effects, we present safe latent diffusion (SLD).

Unfortunately, current SGG methods suffer from an information loss regarding the entities' parts during the relation encoding process. To address this, we introduce the Vision rElation TransfOrmer (VETO), consisting of a novel entity part-level relation encoder. We further observe that many existing SGG methods claim to be unbiased, but are still biased towards either head or tail classes. To overcome this bias, we introduce a Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET) learning strategy that captures important relation features without bias towards head or tail classes. Exhaustive experimental results on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that VETO + MEET boosts the predictive performance by up to 47% over the state of the art while being ~10x smaller.},

  Note = {While text-to-image synthesis currently enjoys great popularity among researchers and the general public, the security of these models has been neglected so far. Many text-guided image generation models rely on pre-trained text encoders from external sources, and their users trust that the retrieved models will behave as promised. Unfortunately, this might not be the case. We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demonstrate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk. Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no suspicious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. By then inserting a single character trigger into the prompt, e.g., a non-Latin character or emoji, the adversary can trigger the model to either generate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description. We empirically demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attacks on Stable Diffusion and highlight that the injection process of a single backdoor takes less than two minutes. Besides phrasing our approach solely as an attack, it can also force an encoder to forget phrases related to certain concepts, such as nudity or violence, and help to make image generation safer.},

In this work, we question the current common practice of storing all information in the model parameters and propose the Revision Transformer (RiT) employing information retrieval to facilitate easy model updating. The specific combination of a large-scale pre-trained LM that inherently but also diffusely encodes world knowledge with a clear-structured revision engine makes it possible to update the model's knowledge with little effort and the help of user interaction. We exemplify RiT on a moral dataset and simulate user feedback demonstrating strong performance in model revision even with small data. This way, users can easily design a model regarding their preferences, paving the way for more transparent and personalized AI models.},

In contrast to neural networks, they are often assumed to be well-calibrated and robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we show that PCs are in fact not robust to OOD data, i.e., they don’t know what they don’t know. We then show how this challenge can be overcome by model uncertainty quantification. To this end, we propose tractable dropout inference (TDI), an inference procedure to estimate uncertainty by deriving an analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) through variance propagation. Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network evaluations, TDI provides tractable sampling-free uncertainty estimates in a single forward pass. TDI improves the robustness of PCs to distribution shift and OOD data, demonstrated through a series of experiments evaluating the classification confidence and uncertainty estimates on real-world data.},

Unfortunately, despite their good object localization and segmentation capabilities, their object encodings may still be suboptimal for downstream reasoning tasks, such as reinforcement learning. To overcome this, we propose to exploit object motion and continuity (objects do not pop in and out of existence). This is accomplished through two mechanisms: (i) providing temporal loss-based priors on object locations, and (ii) a contrastive object continuity loss across consecutive frames. Rather than developing an explicit deep architecture, the resulting unsupervised Motion and Object Continuity (MOC) training scheme can be instantiated using any object detection model baseline. Our results show large improvements in the performances of variational and slot-based models in terms of object discovery, convergence speed and overall latent object representations, particularly for playing Atari games. Overall, we show clear benefits of integrating motion and object continuity for downstream reasoning tasks, moving beyond object representation learning based only on reconstruction as well as evaluation based only on instance segmentation quality.},

a system for safe and robust mission design, i.e., the way we
formalise intentions and decide their execution as trajectories for
the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Although legal frameworks
have emerged to govern urban airspaces, their full integration
into the decision process of autonomous agents and operators
remains an open task. In this work we present ProMis, a system
architecture for probabilistic mission design. It links the data
available from various static and dynamic data sources with
legal text and operator requirements by following principles of
formal verification and probabilistic modeling. Using ProMis,
combining low-level perception and high-level rules in AAM
can be applied to the navigation frame of the UAV. To this
end, we employ Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP)
as a unifying, intermediate representation between perception
and action-taking. Furthermore, we present methods to connect
ProMis with crowd-sourced map data by generating HPLP atoms
that represent spatial relations in a probabilistic fashion. Our

AlphaZero-like frameworks which combine Monte-Carlo tree search with reinforcement learning have been successfully applied to numerous games with perfect information. However, they have not been developed for domains where uncertainty and unknowns abound, and are therefore often considered unsuitable due to imperfect observations. Here, we challenge this view and argue that they are a viable alternative for games with imperfect information—a domain currently dominated by heuristic approaches or methods explicitly designed for hidden information, such as oracle-based techniques. To this end, we introduce a novel algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, called AlphaZe**, which is an AlphaZero-based framework for games with imperfect information. We examine its learning convergence on the games Stratego and DarkHex and show that it is a surprisingly strong baseline, while using a model-based approach: it achieves similar win rates against other Stratego bots like Pipeline Policy Space Response Oracle (P2SRO), while not winning in direct comparison against P2SRO or reaching the much stronger numbers of DeepNash. Compared to heuristics and oracle-based approaches, AlphaZe** can easily deal with rule changes, e.g., when more information than usual is given, and drastically outperforms other approaches in this respect.},

  However, most classical use cases only feature up to two players. Scaling the search to an arbitrary
  number of players presents a computational challenge, especially if decisions have to be planned
  over a longer time horizon. In this work, we investigate techniques that transform general-sum
  multiplayer games into single-player and two-player games that consider other agents to act
  according to given opponent models. For our evaluation, we focus on the challenging Pommerman
  environment which involves partial observability, a long time horizon and sparse rewards. In
  combination with our search methods, we investigate the phenomena of opponent modeling using
  heuristics and self-play. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiplayer search

      Note = {Approximate matching is a well-known concept in digital forensics to determine the similarity between digital artifacts.An important use case of approximate matching is the reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a blacklist (e.g., malware or corporate secrets), if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if only a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital forensic investigation, the approximate matching algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the
      blacklisted malware. However, traditional approximate matching functions like TLSH and ssdeep fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is relatively small compared to the overall file size (e.g., like one-third of the total file). A second well-known issue with traditional approximate matching algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the ever-increasing lookup databases. In this paper, we propose an improved matching algorithm based on transformer-based models from the field of natural language processing. We call our approach
      Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM). As a concept from artificial intelligence, DLAM gets knowledge of characteristic blacklisted patterns during its training phase. Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in a typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment detection. Our evaluation is inspired by two widespread blacklist use cases: the detection of malware (e.g., in JavaScript) and corporate secrets (e.g., pdf or office documents). We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the prominent conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. First, it makes the tedious extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now before any search for them with approximate matching algorithms. This allows efficient classification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to exponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use case, DLAM achieves a similar (in case of mrsh-cf and mrsh-v2) or
      even significantly higher accuracy (in case of ssdeep and TLSH) in recovering fragments of blacklisted files. For instance, in the case of JavaScript files, our assessment shows that DLAM provides an accuracy of 93\% on our test corpus, while TLSH and ssdeep show a classification accuracy of only 50%. Third, we show that DLAM enables the detection of file correlations in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for fragment sizes, where the respective matching function of TLSH and ssdeep fails.},

humans, it is hardly possible to fully understand the rationale behind the black-box
results, and thus, these powerful methods hamper the creation of new knowledge on
the part of humans and the acceptance of this technology on a broader basis.
Explainable Artificial Intelligence tries to solve this problem by making the results more
interpretable, while Interactive Machine Learning integrates humans into the process of
insight discovery. We build upon recent successes of combining these two cuttingedge
technologies and propose how Explanatory Interactive Machine Learning (XIL) is
embedded in a generalizable Action Design Research (ADR) process – which we call
XIL-ADR. This approach can be used to analyze data, inspect models, and iteratively
improve them. We show the application of this process and use the diagnosis of viral
pneumonia, e.g., Covid-19, as an illustrative example. By this means, this paper also
illustrates how XIL-ADR can help identify shortcomings of standard machine learning
projects, gain new insights on the part of the human user, and thereby help to tap the
full potential of AI-based systems for organizations and research.}

We assume the presence of a human expert who can interactively provide the relations. Thus there is a need for an explainable model. Consequently, we employ an relational tree-based distance metric to identify the most diverse set of relational examples (entities) to obtain more relational feature information on. The model that is learned iteratively is an interpretable and explainable model that is presented to the human expert for eliciting additional features. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates both the efficiency and the interpretability of the proposed approach.},

However, achieving high-quality results is almost unfeasible in a one-shot fashion. On the contrary, text-guided image generation involves the user making many slight changes to inputs in order to iteratively carve out the envisioned image. However, slight changes to the input prompt often lead to entirely different images being generated, and thus the control of the artist is limited in its granularity. To provide flexibility, we present the Stable Artist, an image editing approach enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process. The main component is semantic guidance (SEGA) which steers the diffusion process along variable numbers of semantic directions. This allows for subtle edits to images, changes in composition and style, as well as optimization of the overall artistic conception. Furthermore, SEGA enables probing of latent spaces to gain insights into the representation of concepts learned by the model, even complex ones such as 'carbon emission'. We demonstrate the Stable Artist on several tasks, showcasing high-quality image editing and composition.},

  Note={How long do vulnerabilities live in the repositories of large, evolving projects? Although the question has been identified as an interesting problem by the software community in online forums, it has not been investigated yet in adequate depth and scale, since the process of identifying the exact point in time when a vulnerability was introduced is particularly cumbersome. In this paper, we provide an automatic approach for accurately estimating how long vulnerabilities remain in the code (their lifetimes). Our method relies on the observation that while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact point of introduction for one vulnerability, it is possible to accurately estimate the average lifetime of a large enough sample of vulnerabilities, via a heuristic approach. With our approach, we perform the first large-scale measurement of Free and Open Source Software vulnerability lifetimes, going beyond approaches estimating lower bounds prevalent in previous research. We find that the average lifetime of a vulnerability is around 4 years, varying significantly between projects (~2 years for Chromium, ~7 years for OpenSSL). The distribution of lifetimes can be approximately described by an exponential distribution. There are no statistically significant differences between the lifetimes of different vulnerability types when considering specific projects. Vulnerabilities are getting older, as the average lifetime of fixed vulnerabilities in a given year increases over time, influenced by the overall increase of code age. However, they live less than non-vulnerable code, with an increasing spread over time for some projects, suggesting a notion of maturity that can be considered an indicator of quality. While the introduction of fuzzers does not significantly reduce the lifetimes of memory-related vulnerabilities, further research is needed to better understand and quantify the impact of fuzzers and other tools on vulnerability lifetimes and on the security of codebases.}

  Note = {While text-to-image synthesis currently enjoys great popularity among researchers and the general public, the security of these models has been neglected so far. Many text-guided image generation models rely on pre-trained text encoders from external sources, and their users trust that the retrieved models will behave as promised. Unfortunately, this might not be the case. We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demonstrate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk. Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no suspicious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. By then inserting a single non-Latin character into the prompt, the adversary can trigger the model to either generate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description. We empirically demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attacks on Stable Diffusion and highlight that the injection process of a single backdoor takes less than two minutes. Besides phrasing our approach solely as an attack, it can also force an encoder to forget phrases related to certain concepts, such as nudity or violence, and help to make image generation safer.},

For an analysis of the site-specific wind conditions, Virtual Meteorological Masts (VMMs) are frequently used. VMMs make use of site calibrated numerical data to provide precise wind estimates during all phases of a wind energy project. Typically, numerical data are used for the long-term correlation that is required for estimating the yield of new wind farm projects. However, VMMs can also be used to fill data gaps or during the operational phase as an additional reference data set to detect degrading sensors. The value of a VMM directly depends on its ability and precision to reproduce site-specific environmental conditions. Commonly, linear regression is used as state of the art to correct reference data to the site-specific conditions. In this study, a framework of 10 different machine-learning methods is tested to investigated the benefit of more advanced methods on two offshore and one onshore site. We find significantly improving correlations between the VMMs and the reference data when using more advanced methods and present the most promising ones. The K-Nearest Neighbors and AdaBoost regressors show the best results in our study, but Multi-Output Mixture of Gaussian Processes is also very promising. The use of more advanced regression models lead to decreased uncertainties; hence those methods should find its way into industrial applications. The recommended regression models can serve as a starting point for the development of end-user applications and services.}

We show that by simply inserting single non-Latin characters in a textual description, common models reflect cultural stereotypes and biases in their generated images. We analyze this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identify a model’s text encoder as the root cause of the phenomenon. Additionally, malicious users or service providers may try to intentionally bias the image generation to create racist stereotypes by replacing Latin characters with similarly-looking characters from non-Latin scripts, so-called homoglyphs. To mitigate such unnoticed script attacks, we propose a novel homoglyph unlearning method to fine-tune a text encoder, making it robust against homoglyph manipulations.},

The proposed Identity Inference Attack (IDIA) reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.},

The changes in metabolites, for example chlorophyll or flavonoids, have long been detectable using time-consuming destructive analytical methods including high-performance liquid chromatography or photometric determination. Recent plant phenotyping studies have revealed that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the UV-range can be used to link spectral changes with changes in plant metabolites. To compare established destructive analytical methods with new non-destructive hyperspectral measurements, the interaction between sugar beet leaves and the pathogens Cercospora beticola, which causes Cercospora leaf spot disease (CLS), and Uromyces betae, which causes sugar beet rust (BR), was investigated. With the help of destructive analyses, we showed that both diseases have different effects on chlorophylls, carotenoids, flavonoids, and several phenols. Non-destructive hyperspectral measurements in the UV-range revealed different effects of CLS and BR on plant metabolites resulting in distinct reflectance patterns. Both diseases resulted in specific spectral changes that allowed differentiation between the two diseases. Machine learning algorithms enabled the differentiation between the symptom classes and recognition of the two sugar beet diseases. Feature importance analysis identified specific wavelengths important to the classification, highlighting the utility of the UV-range. The study demonstrates that HSI in the UV-range is a promising, non-destructive tool to investigate the influence of plant diseases on plant physiology and biochemistry.},

Although a natural question for predominant static benchmarks, the notion to train systems in a lifelong manner entails a plethora of additional challenges with respect to set-up and evaluation. The latter have recently sparked a growing amount of critiques on prominent algorithm-centric perspectives and evaluation protocols being too narrow, resulting in several attempts at constructing guidelines in favor of specific desiderata or arguing against the validity of prevalent assumptions. In this work, we depart from this mindset and argue that the goal of a precise formulation of desiderata is an ill-posed one, as diverse applications may always warrant distinct scenarios. Instead, we introduce the Continual Learning EValuation Assessment Compass, CLEVA-Compass for short. The compass provides the visual means to both identify how approaches are practically reported and how works can simultaneously be contextualized in the broader literature landscape. In addition to promoting compact specification in the spirit of recent replication trends, the CLEVA-Compass thus provides an intuitive chart to understand the priorities of individual systems, where they resemble each other, and what elements are missing towards a fair comparison.},

This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Plug \& Play Attacks that loosen the dependency between the target model and image prior and enable the use of a single trained GAN to attack a broad range of targets with only minor attack adjustments needed. Moreover, we show that powerful MIAs are possible even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong distributional shifts, whereas previous approaches fail to produce meaningful results. Our extensive evaluation confirms the improved robustness and flexibility of Plug \& Play Attacks and their ability to create high-quality images revealing sensitive class characteristics.},

We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures. Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since overconfidence leads to high false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked than previously assumed. Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of models and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know, making low confidence predictions, the more they reveal the training data.},

To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets -- ImageNet and OpenImages -- produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.},

Despite the wide range of anomaly detection approaches, localization of detected anomalies in multivariate and Multi-sensor time-series data remains a challenge. Interpretation and anomaly attribution is critical and could improve the analysis and decision-making for many applications. With anomaly attribution, explanations can be leveraged to understand, on a per-anomaly basis, which sensors cause the root of anomaly and which features are the most important in causing an anomaly. To this end, we propose using saliency-based Explainable-AI approaches to localize the essential sensors responsible for anomalies in an unsupervised manner. While most Explainable AI methods are considered as interpreters of AI models, we show for the first time that Saliency Explainable AI can be utilized in Multi-sensor Anomaly localization applications. Our approach is demonstrated for localizing the detected anomalies in an unsupervised multi-sensor setup, and the experiments show promising results. We evaluate and compare different classes of saliency explainable AI approach on the Server Machine Data (SMD) Dataset and compared the results with the state-of-the-art OmniAnomaly Localization approach. The results of our empirical analysis demonstrate a promising performance.}

  understand in terms of relationships between inputs and outputs. As a linear program only provides the
  optimal solution to an optimization problem, further explanations are often helpful. In this work, we
  extend the attribution methods for explaining neural networks to linear programs. These methods explain
  the model by providing relevance scores for the model inputs, to show the influence of each input on the
  output. Alongside using classical gradient-based attribution methods we also propose a way to adapt
  perturbation-based attribution methods to LPs. Our evaluations of several different linear and integer
  problems showed that attribution methods can generate useful explanations for linear programs. However,
  we also demonstrate that using a neural attribution method directly might come with some drawbacks, as
  the properties of these methods on neural networks do not necessarily transfer to linear programs. The

  Note = {Simulations are ubiquitous in machine learning. Especially in graph learning, simulations of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) are being deployed for evaluating new algorithms. In the literature, it was recently argued that continuous-optimization approaches to structure discovery such as NOTEARS might be exploiting the sortability of the variable's variances in the available data due to their use of least square losses. Specifically, since structure discovery is a key problem in science and beyond, we want to be invariant to the scale being used for measuring our data (e.g. meter versus centimeter should not affect the causal direction inferred by the algorithm). In this work, we further strengthen this initial, negative empirical suggestion by both proving key results in the multivariate case and corroborating with further empirical evidence. In particular, we show that we can control the resulting graph with our targeted variance attacks, even in the case where we can only partially manipulate the variances of the data.},

Therefore, it is not surprising that a growing body of work aims to provide interpretability and explainability to black-box LMs: Recent evaluations of saliency or attribution methods find that, while intriguing, different methods assign importance to different inputs for the same outputs, thus encouraging misinterpretation and reporting bias.

Instead, we emphasize using (interactive) prototype networks directly incorporated into the model architecture and hence explain the reasoning behind the network’s decisions.},

By identifying a common set of basic modules and providing a thorough discussion of these modules, our work, for the first time, comes up with a unification of the various methods into a single typology. This typology can thus be used to categorize existing and future XIL methods based on the identified modules. Moreover, our work contributes by surveying six existing XIL methods. In addition to benchmarking these methods on their overall ability to revise a model, we perform additional benchmarks regarding wrong reason revision, interaction efficiency, robustness to feedback quality, and the ability to revise a strongly corrupted model. Apart from introducing these novel benchmarking tasks, for improved quantitative evaluations, we further introduce a novel Wrong Reason (WR) metric which measures the average wrong reason activation in a model's explanations to complement a qualitative inspection. In our evaluations, all methods prove to revise a model successfully. However, we found significant differences between the methods on individual benchmark tasks, revealing valuable application-relevant aspects not only for comparing current methods but also to motivate the necessity of incorporating these benchmarks in the development of future XIL methods.}

The specific combination of a large-scale pre-trained LM that inherently but also diffusely encodes world knowledge with a clear-structured revision engine makes it possible to update the model's knowledge with little effort and the help of user interaction. We exemplify RiT on a moral dataset and simulate user feedback demonstrating strong performance in model revision even with small data. This way, users can easily design a model regarding their preferences, paving the way for more transparent and personalized AI models.}

	Note =  {As the complexity of data increases, so does the importance of powerful representations, such as relational and logical representations, as well as the need for machine learning methods that can learn predictive models in such representations. A characteristic of these representations is that they give rise to a huge number of features to be considered, thus drastically increasing the difficulty of learning in terms of computational complexity and the curse of dimensionality. Despite this, methods for ranking features in this context, i.e., estimating their importance are practically non-existent. Among the most well-known methods for feature ranking are those based on ensembles, and in particular tree ensembles. To develop methods for feature ranking in a relational context, we adopt the relational tree ensemble approach. We thus first develop methods for learning ensembles of relational trees, extending a wide spectrum of tree-based ensemble methods from the propositional to the relational context, resulting in methods for bagging and random forests of relational trees, as well as gradient boosted ensembles thereof. Complex relational features are considered in our ensembles: by using complex aggregates, we extend the standard collection of features that correspond to existential queries, such as `Does this person have any children?', to more complex features that correspond to aggregation queries, such as `What is the average age of this person's children?'. We also calculate feature importance scores and rankings from the different kinds of relational tree ensembles learned, with different kinds of relational features. The rankings provide insight into and explain the ensemble models, which would be otherwise difficult to understand. We compare the methods for learning single trees and different tree ensembles, using only existential qualifiers and using the whole set of relational features, against 10 state-of-the-art methods on a collection of benchmark relational datasets, deriving also the corresponding feature rankings. Overall, the bagging ensembles perform the best, with gradient boosted ensembles following closely. The use of aggregates is beneficial and in some datasets drastically improves performance: In these cases, aggregate-based features clearly stand out in the feature rankings derived from the ensembles.},

Here we ask the arguably "circular" question of whether a machine can help us reflect on inappropriate content, answering Question 16 in Datasheets. To this end, we propose to use the information stored in pre-trained transformer models to assist us in the documentation process. Specifically, prompt-tuning based on a dataset of socio-moral values steers CLIP to identify potentially inappropriate content, therefore reducing human labor. We then document the inappropriate images found using word clouds, based on captions generated using a vision-language model. The documentations of two popular, large-scale computer vision datasets -- ImageNet and OpenImages -- produced this way suggest that machines can indeed help dataset creators to answer Question 16 on inappropriate image content.},

This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Plug \& Play Attacks that loosen the dependency between the target model and image prior and enable the use of a single trained GAN to attack a broad range of targets with only minor attack adjustments needed. Moreover, we show that powerful MIAs are possible even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong distributional shifts, whereas previous approaches fail to produce meaningful results.

A number of works have been proposed to revise deep classifiers to learn the right correlations. However, generative models have been overlooked so far. We observe that generative models are also prone to Clever-Hans-like behaviour. To counteract this issue, we propose to debias generative models by disentangling their internal representations, which is achieved via human feedback. Our experiments show that this is effective at removing bias even when human feedback covers only a small fraction of the desired distribution.

sociability in human-robot interaction. Yet many existing approaches rely on the use of a
set of fixed, preprogrammed joint configurations for expression generation. Automating
this process provides potential advantages to scale better to different robot types and
various expressions. To this end, we introduce ExGenNet, a novel deep generative
approach for facial expressions on humanoid robots. ExGenNets connect a generator
network to reconstruct simplified facial images from robot joint configurations with a
classifier network for state-of-the-art facial expression recognition. The robots’ joint
configurations are optimized for various expressions by backpropagating the loss
between the predicted expression and intended expression through the classification
network and the generator network. To improve the transfer between human training
images and images of different robots, we propose to use extracted features in the
classifier as well as in the generator network. Unlike most studies on facial expression
generation, ExGenNets can produce multiple configurations for each facial expression and
be transferred between robots. Experimental evaluations on two robots with highly humanlike
faces, Alfie (Furhat Robot) and the android robot Elenoide, show that ExGenNet can
successfully generate sets of joint configurations for predefined facial expressions on both
robots. This ability of ExGenNet to generate realistic facial expressions was further
validated in a pilot study where the majority of human subjects could accurately
recognize most of the generated facial expressions on both the robots.},

      Note = {Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific sample was used to train a predictive model. Knowing this may indeed lead to a privacy breach. Arguably, most MIAs, however, make use of the model's prediction scores - the probability of each output given some input - following the intuition that the trained model tends to behave differently on its training data. We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures, e.g., ReLU type neural networks produce almost always high prediction scores far away from the training data. Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since this behavior leads to high false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated and less information is leaked than previously assumed. Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of classifiers and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know, making low confidence predictions far away from the training data, the more they reveal the training data.},

      author={Lukas Struppek and Dominik Hintersdorf and Daniel Neider and Kristian Kersting},
      Note = {Apple recently revealed its deep perceptual hashing system NeuralHash to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on user devices before files are uploaded to its iCloud service. Public criticism quickly arose regarding the protection of user privacy and the system's reliability. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying slight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations, forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system: from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users, everything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, inferences can still be made about the data stored on user devices. In our view, based on our results, deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for robust client-side scanning and should not be used from a privacy perspective. },

Recent advancements in neuro-symbolic AI often consider specifically-tailored architectures consisting of disjoint neural and symbolic components, and thus do not exhibit desired gains that can be achieved by integrating them into a unifying framework. We introduce SLASH -- a novel deep probabilistic programming language (DPPL). At its core, SLASH consists of Neural-Probabilistic Predicates (NPPs) and logical programs which are united via answer set programming. The probability estimates resulting from NPPs act as the binding element between the logical program and raw input data, thereby allowing SLASH to answer task-dependent logical queries. This allows SLASH to elegantly integrate the symbolic and neural components in a unified framework. We evaluate SLASH on the benchmark data of MNIST addition as well as novel tasks for DPPLs such as missing data prediction and set prediction with state-of-the-art performance, thereby showing the effectiveness and generality of our method. },

  Note = {Reasoning is an essential part of human intelligence and thus has been a long-standing goal in artificial intelligence research. With the recent success of deep learning, incorporating reasoning with deep learning systems, i.e., neuro-symbolic AI has become a major field of interest. We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Forward Reasoner (NSFR), a new approach for reasoning tasks taking advantage of differentiable forward-chaining using first-order logic. The key idea is to combine differentiable forward-chaining reasoning with object-centric (deep) learning. Differentiable forward-chaining reasoning computes logical entailments smoothly, i.e., it deduces new facts from given facts and rules in a differentiable manner. The object-centric learning approach factorizes raw inputs into representations in terms of objects. Thus, it allows us to provide a consistent framework to perform the forward-chaining inference from raw inputs. NSFR factorizes the raw inputs into the object-centric representations, converts them into probabilistic ground atoms, and finally performs differentiable forward-chaining inference using weighted rules for inference. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on object-centric reasoning data sets, 2D Kandinsky patterns and 3D CLEVR-Hans, and a variety of tasks show the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.},

Consequently, there is an urgent need to carefully document datasets and curate their content. Unfortunately, this process is tedious and error-prone. We show that pre-trained transformers themselves provide a methodology for the automated curation of large-scale vision datasets. Based on human-annotated examples and the implicit knowledge of a CLIP based model, we demonstrate that one can select relevant prompts for rating the offensiveness of an image.

Given their accuracy performance, currently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the models of choice for this task.

This could be extremely useful in practice in several cases e.g. to detect when a prediction might be completely wrong due to an unusual pattern in the time series. Whittle Sum-Product Networks (WSPNs), prominent deep tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs) for time series, can assist an RNN with providing meaningful probabilities as uncertainty measure. With this aim, we propose RECOWN, a novel architecture that employs RNNs and a discriminant variant of WSPNs called Conditional WSPNs (CWSPNs). We also formulate a Log-Likelihood Ratio Score as an estimation of uncertainty that is tailored to time series and Whittle likelihoods. In our experiments, we show that RECOWNs are accurate and trustworthy time series predictors, able to "know when they do not know".},

have made substantial progress in recent years, they perform poorly on oriented objects which are common in several realworld scenarios such as aerial view imagery and security
camera footage. In these cases, a large part of a predicted bounding box will, undesirably, cover non-object related areas. Therefore, oriented object detection has emerged with
the aim of generalizing object detection to arbitrary orientations. This enables a tighter fit to oriented objects, leading to
a better separation of bounding boxes especially in case of dense object distributions. The vast majority of the work in
this area has focused on complex two-stage anchor-based approaches, where the detection is split into a region-of-interest
identification step followed by the object localization and classification based on sets of predefined bounding box anchors. These anchors act as priors on the bounding box shape
and require attentive hyper-parameter fine-tuning on a perdataset basis, increased model size, and come with computational overhead. In this work, we present DAFNe: A Dense
one-stage Anchor-Free deep Network for oriented object detection. As a one-stage model, DAFNe performs predictions
on a dense grid over the input image, being architecturally simpler in design, as well as easier to optimize than its twostage counterparts. Furthermore, as an anchor-free model,
DAFNe reduces the prediction complexity by refraining from employing bounding box anchors. Moreover, we introduce
an orientation-aware generalization of the center-ness function for arbitrarily oriented bounding boxes to down-weight
low-quality predictions and a center-to-corner bounding box prediction strategy that improves object localization performance. Our experiments show that, to the best of our knowledge, DAFNe outperforms all previous one-stage anchor-free
models on DOTA 1.0. DAFNe improves the prediction accuracy over the previous best results by 4.65% mAP, setting the
new state-of-the-art results by achieving 76.95% mAP.}

  Keywords = {Causality, Graph Neural Networks, Neural-Causal Models},
  Note = {Causality can be described in terms of a structural causal model (SCM) that
  carries information on the variables of interest and their mechanistic
relations. For most processes of interest the underlying SCM will only be
partially observable, thus causal inference tries to leverage any exposed
information. Graph neural networks (GNN) as universal approximators on
structured input pose a viable candidate for causal learning, suggesting a
tighter integration with SCM. To this effect we present a theoretical analysis
from first principles that establishes a novel connection between GNN and SCM
while providing an extended view on general neural-causal models. We then
establish a new model class for GNN-based causal inference that is necessary
and sufficient for causal effect identification. Our empirical illustration on
simulations and standard benchmarks validate our theoretical proofs.},

  Here, we argue that they are more general in nature and can easily affect a larger class of models, e.g., any
  differentiable perturbed optimizers. We further show that such attacks can be determined by the hidden confounders
  in a domain, thus drawing a novel connection between such attacks and causality. Establishing this causal perspective
  is characterized by the influence of the structural causal model's data generating process on the subsequent optimization
  thereby exhibiting intriguing parameters of the former. We reveal the existence of such parameters for three combinatorial
  optimization problems, namely linear assignment, shortest path and a real world problem of energy systems.
  Our empirical examination also unveils worrisome consequences of these attacks on differentiable perturbed

data from their shared gradients. The attack exploits the direction and
magnitude of gradients to determine the presence or absence of any
label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of leaking potential sensitive
information represented by labels, and scales well to arbitrary batch sizes
and multiple classes. We empirically and mathematically demonstrate
the validity of our attack under different settings. Moreover, empirical
results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with high accuracy
at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different defense
mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient
compression is a practical technique to prevent our attack.},

  Note = {Inspired by recent advances in the field of expert-based approximations of Gaussian processes (GPs),
  we present an expert-based approach to large-scale multi-output regression using single-output GP experts.
  Employing a deeply structured mixture of single-output GPs encoded via a probabilistic circuit allows us to
  accurately capture correlations between multiple output dimensions. By recursively partitioning the covariate
  space and the output space, posterior inference in our model reduces to inference on single-output GP experts,
  which only need to be conditioned on a small subset of the observations. We show that inference can be
  performed exactly and efficiently in our model, that it can capture correlations between output dimensions and,
  hence, often outperforms approaches that do not incorporate inter-output correlations, as demonstrated on
  several datasets in terms of the negative log predictive density.},

  Note = {While probabilistic circuits have been extensively explored for tabular data,
  less attention has been paid to time series. Here, the goal is to estimate joint densities among
  the entire time series and, in turn, determining, for instance, conditional independence relations
  between them. To this end, we propose the first probabilistic circuits (PCs) approach to model
  time series, called Whittle sum-product networks (WSPNs). WSPNs leverage the Whittle approximation,
  casting the likelihood in the frequency domain, and place a complex-valued sum-product network, the
  most prominent PC, over the frequencies. The conditional independence relations among the time series
  can then be determined efficiently in the spectral domain. Moreover, WSPNs can naturally be placed
  into the deep neural learning stack for time series, resulting in Whittle Networks, opening the
  likelihood toolbox for training deep neural models and inspecting their behaviour. Our experiments show
  that Whittle Networks can indeed capture complex dependencies between time series and provide a useful
  measure of uncertainty for neural networks.},

    Using them as pretrained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have
    extended the state of the art for many NLP tasks and shown that they not only capture linguistic
    knowledge but also retain general knowledge implicitly present in the data. These and other successes
    are exciting. Unfortunately, LMs trained on unfiltered text corpora suffer from degenerate
    and biased behaviour. While this is well established, we show that recent improvements of LMs also store
    ethical and moral values of the society and actually bring a ``moral dimension'' to surface: the
    values are capture geometrically by a direction in the embedding space, reflecting well the agreement
    of phrases to social norms implicitly expressed in the training texts. This provides a path for
    attenuating or even preventing toxic degeneration in LMs. Since one can now rate the (non-)normativity
    of arbitrary phrases without explicitly training the LM for this task, the moral dimension can be used
    as ``moral compass'' guiding (even other) LMs towards producing normative text, as we will show. },

  	Note = {Most explanation methods in deep learning map importance estimates for a model's prediction back to the original input space. These "visual" explanations are often insufficient, as the model's actual concept remains elusive. Moreover, without insights into the model's semantic concept, it is difficult -- if not impossible -- to intervene on the model's behavior via its explanations, called Explanatory Interactive Learning. Consequently, we propose to intervene on a Neuro-Symbolic scene representation, which allows one to revise the model on the semantic level, e.g. "never focus on the color to make your decision". We compiled a novel confounded visual scene data set, the CLEVR-Hans data set, capturing complex compositions of different objects. The results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can identify confounders that are not identifiable using "visual" explanations only. More importantly, feedback on this semantic level makes it possible to revise the model from focusing on these confounding factors.},

A hyperspectral imaging set-up was established to highlight the influence of early plant-pathogen interactions on secondary plant metabolites. In this study, the plant-pathogen interactions of three different barley lines inoculated with Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh, powdery mildew) were carried out. One susceptible genotype (Ingrid wild type) and two resistant genotypes (Pallas 01, Mla1 and Mla12 based resistance and Pallas 22, mlo5 based resistance) were used. During the first 5 days after inoculation (dai) the plant reflectance patterns were recorded and in parallel plant metabolites relevant in host-pathogen interaction were studied. Hyperspectral measurements in the UV-range revealed that a differentiation between resistant and susceptible barley genotypes inoculated with Bgh is possible and distinct reflectance patterns were recorded for each genotype. The extracted and analyzed pigments and flavonoids correlated with the spectral data recorded. A classification of non-inoculated and inoculated samples with deep learning revealed that a high performance was achieved with self-attention networks. The subsequent feature importance identified wavelengths, which were most important for the classification, and these wavelengths were linked to pigments and flavonoids. Hyperspectral imaging in the UV-range allows for a characterisation of different resistance reactions, can be linked to changes of secondary plant metabolites with the advantage of being a non-invasive method and therefore enables a greater understanding of the plants' reaction to biotic stress as well as resistance reactions.},

Note = {Explaining black-box models such as deep neural networks is becoming increasingly important as it helps to boost trust and debugging.
Popular forms of explanations map the features to a vector indicating their individual importance to a decision on the instance-level.
They can then be used to prevent the model from learning the wrong bias in data possibly due to ambiguity. For instance, Ross et al.'s
"right for the right reasons" propagates user explanations backwards to the network by formulating differentiable constraints based on input gradients.
Unfortunately, input gradients as well as many other widely used explanation methods form an approximation of the decision boundary and assume
the underlying model to be fixed. Here, we demonstrate how to make use of influence functions - a well known robust statistic - in the constraints
to correct the model’s behaviour more effectively. Our empirical evidence demonstrates that this "right for better reasons" (RBR) considerably
reduces the time to correct the classifier at training time and boosts the quality of explanations at inference time compared to input gradients.
Besides, we also showcase the effectiveness of RBR in correcting "Clever Hans"-like behaviour in real, high-dimensional domain.},

	author={Wolfgang Stammer and Patrick Schramowski and Kristian Kersting},
	Note = {Most explanation methods in deep learning map importance estimates for a model's prediction back to the original input space. These "visual" explanations are often insufficient, as the model's actual concept remains elusive. Moreover, without insights into the model's semantic concept, it is difficult -- if not impossible -- to intervene on the model's behavior via its explanations, called Explanatory Interactive Learning. Consequently, we propose to intervene on a Neuro-Symbolic scene representation, which allows one to revise the model on the semantic level, e.g. "never focus on the color to make your decision". We compiled a novel confounded visual scene data set, the CLEVR-Hans data set, capturing complex compositions of different objects. The results of our experiments on CLEVR-Hans demonstrate that our semantic explanations, i.e. compositional explanations at a per-object level, can identify confounders that are not identifiable using "visual" explanations only. More importantly, feedback on this semantic level makes it possible to revise the model from focusing on these confounding factors.},

Providing an arbitrarily intervened causal graph as input, effectively subsuming Pearl's do-operator, the gate function predicts the parameters of the SPN. The resulting interventional SPNs are motivated and illustrated by a structural causal model themed around personal health. Our empirical evaluation on three benchmark data sets as well as a synthetic health data set clearly demonstrates that interventional SPNs indeed are both expressive in modelling and flexible in adapting to the interventions.},

In contrast, deep probabilistic models such as sum-product networks (SPNs) capture joint distributions in a tractable fashion, but still lack the expressive power of
intractable models based on deep neural networks. Therefore, we introduce conditional SPNs (CSPNs), conditional density estimators for multivariate and potentially hybrid domains that allow harnessing the expressive power of neural networks while still maintaining tractability guarantees. One way to implement CSPNs is to use an existing SPN structure and condition its parameters on the input, e.g., via a deep neural network. Our experimental evidence demonstrates that CSPNs are competitive with other probabilistic models and yield superior performance on multilabel image classification compared to mean field and mixture density networks. Furthermore, they can successfully be employed as building blocks for structured probabilistic models, such as autoregressive image models.},

The main trick is to ensemble SPNs by explicitly reformulating sum nodes as residual functions. This adds references to substructures across the SPNs at different depths, which in turn helps to improve training. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting residual SPNs (ResSPNs) are easy to optimize, gain performance from considerably increased depth and width, and are competitive to state-of-the-art SPN structure learning approaches.

        Combining deep classifiers with knowledge expressed in the form of rules and constraints
        allows one to leverage different forms of abstractions within argumentation mining.
        Argumentation for ma-chine learning can yield argumentation-based learning methods where the
        machine and the user argue about the learned model with the common goal of providing results of
         maximum utility to the user. Unfortunately, both directions are currently rather challenging.
         For instance, combining deep neural models with logic typically only yields determinisic
         results, while combining probabilistic models with logic often results in intractable
         inference. Therefore, we review a novel deep but tractable model for conditional probability
         distributions  that  can  harness  the  expressive  power  of universal  function  approximators
         such  as  neural  networks while still maintaining a wide range of tractable inference routines.
         While this new model has shown appealing performance in classification tasks, humans cannot
         easily under-stand the reasons for its decision. Therefore, we also review our recent efforts
         on how to “argue” with deep models. On synthetic and real data we illustrate how “arguing”
         with a deep model about its explanations can actually help to revise the model, if it is
         right for the wrong reasons. We only sketch and review our recent efforts. More details can be

In this paper, we propose Einsum Networks (EiNets), a novel implementation design for PCs, improving prior art in several regards. At their core, EiNets combine a large number of arithmetic operations in a single monolithic einsum-operation, leading to speedups and memory savings of up to two orders of magnitude, in comparison to previous implementations. As an algorithmic contribution, we show that the implementation of Expectation-Maximization (EM) can be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EiNets scale well to datasets which were previously out of reach, such as SVHN and CelebA, and that they can be used as faithful generative image models.},

machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? In this study, we show that applying machine learning to human
texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about ``right" and ``wrong" conduct.
We create a template list of prompts and responses, such as ``Should I [action]?'', ``Is it okay to [action]?'', etc. with corresponding
answers of ``Yes/no, I should (not).'' and "Yes/no, it is (not)." The model's bias score is now the difference between the model's
score of the positive response (``Yes, I should'') and that of the negative response (``No, I should not''). For a given choice, the
model's overall bias score is the mean of the bias scores of all question/answer templates paired with that choice.
Specifically, the resulting model, called the Moral Choice Machine (MCM), calculates the bias score on a sentence level using
embeddings of the Universal Sentence Encoder since the moral value of an action to be taken depends on its context. It is
objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time. It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt. It is important to
spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation.
Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and moral choices, even
with context information. Actually, training the Moral Choice Machine on different temporal news and book corpora from year
1510 to 2008/09 demonstrate the evolution of moral and ethical choices over different time periods for both atomic actions and
actions with context information. By training it on different cultural sources such as the Bible and the constitution of different
countries, dynamics of moral choices in culture, including technology are revealed. That is the fact that moral biases can be
extracted, quantified, tracked, and compared across cultures and over time.},

  supports ad-hoc queries but also updates of the data without the need to retrain when the workload or data changes.
  Indeed, one may expect that this comes at a price of lower accuracy since workload-driven models can make use of more information.

goals in the relational setting, by allowing probabilistic predicates to be specified as (conditional)
distributions defined via deep neural networks. The resulting systems allow relational probabilistic
models with deep components to be trained end-to-end. However, in this setting, deep models are
used purely as conditional density estimators. This limits the types of inferences that are possible
in the resulting system: Lacking any model for the inputs of the neural network, missing values
can not be inferred or sampled. To overcome these obstacles we propose a novel
deep relational probabilistic PL — "SPLog: Sum-Product Logic", the main components of which

deep generative model with the crucial property that all conditional and marginal queries may be
answered exactly in linear time. In this extended abstract, we show how to leverage this feature in

tasks remotely on sensitive client data in a privacy-preserving way: the server learns nothing about the input data and the model predictions,
while the client learns nothing about the ML model (which is often considered intellectual property and might contain traces
of sensitive data). While such privacy-preserving solutions are relatively efficient, they are mostly targeted at neural networks, can
degrade the predictive accuracy, and usually reveal the network’s topology. Furthermore, existing solutions are not readily accessible

In this paper, we present CryptoSPN, a framework for privacypreserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs). SPNs are a
tractable probabilistic graphical model that allows a range of exact inference queries in linear time. Specifically, we show how to

    But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed
    that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about "right" and "wrong"
    conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is
    objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it
    is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted
    to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa
    and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass?
    In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve
    the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation
    of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral
    Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.},

                  this, though, SPN have to obey specific structural

However, inference in the overall model is highly intractable, which hampers its learning speed and makes it prone to sub-optimal solutions.
In this paper, we show that inference and learning in AIR can be considerably accelerated by replacing the intractable object representations with tractable probabilistic models.
In particular, we opt for sum-product (SP) networks, an expressive deep probabilistic model with a rich set of tractable inference routines.
As our empirical evidence shows, the resulting model, called SuPAIR, achieves a higher object detection accuracy than the original AIR system, while reducing the learning time by an order of magnitude.
Moreover, SuPAIR allows one to treat object occlusions in a consistent manner and to include a background noise model, improving the robustness of Bayesian scene understanding.},

plant substances. To record reliable and reproducible time series results, measurement conditions
were defined that exclude phototoxic effects of UV-illumination in the plant tissue. The measurement
quality of the UV-camera has been assessed by comparing it to a non-imaging UV-spectrometer by
measuring six different white-colored plant-based substances. Given the findings of these preliminary
studies, an experiment has been defined and performed monitoring the stress response of barley
leaves to salt stress. The aim was to visualize the effects of abiotic stress within the UV-range to
provide new insights into the stress response of plants visualizing the effects of abiotic stress within

Since, in discrete domains, ACs are essentially equivalent to mixtures of trees, DACBOOST decomposes
a large AC into smaller tree-structured ACs and learns them in a sequential, additive
manner. The resulting non-parametric manner of learning the DACs results in a model with very
few tuning parameters making our learned model significantly more efficient. We demonstrate on
standard data sets and some real-world data sets, the efficiency of DACBOOST compared to the
state-of-the-art DAC learners without sacrificing the effectiveness. This makes it possible to employ
DACs for large scale real-world tasks.},

In the past years, the database community has been working on different techniques for Approximate Query Processing (AQP) that aim to deliver an approximate query result given a fixed time bound to support interactive visualizations better. However, classical AQP approaches suffer from various problems that limit the applicability to support the ad-hoc exploration of a new data set: (1) Classical AQP approaches that perform online sampling can support ad-hoc exploration queries but yield low quality if executed over rare subpopulations. (2) Classical AQP approaches that rely on offline sampling can use some form of biased sampling to mitigate these problems but require a priori knowledge of the workload, which is often not realistic if users want to explore a new database. In this paper, we present a new approach to AQP called Model-based AQP that leverages generative models learned over the complete database to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds. Different from classical AQP approaches, generative models allow us to compute responses to ad-hoc queries and deliver high-quality estimates also over rare subpopulations at the same time. In our experiments with real and synthetic data sets, we show that Model-based AQP can in many scenarios return more accurate results in a shorter runtime. Furthermore, we think that our techniques of using generative models presented in this paper can not only be used for AQP in databases but also has applications for other database problems including Query Optimization as well as Data Cleaning.},

  Note = {Probabilistic models provide a framework for describing abstract prior knowledge and using it to reason under uncertainty. Deep probabilistic programming languages (PPL) are a powerful tool to ease the development of probabilistic models. They let users specify generative probabilistic models as programs and then ``compile'' those models down into inference procedures. Since probabilistic inference is still intractable, existing deep PPLs leverage deep learning for inference. The key idea is to describe inference via a second model called an inference model trained in variational fashion. Both the generative and the inference models can include deep neural networks as components.
While the details of the employed neural architectures may differ, they typically model distributions only implicitly, i.e., they allow for sampling but not the computation of marginal probabilities.
This extended abstract makes the case to not "go down the full neural road", but to explicitly obtain uncertainties in an arithmetic circuit manner. To this end, sum-product networks (SPNs) are a promising option, as they are a class of probabilistic model which permit explicit uncertainties and efficient inference.
More precisely, SPNs can compute any marginalization and conditioning query in time linear of the model's representation size. Although SPNs can be described in a nutshell as "deep mixture models", they have received no attention in the deep PPL community, despite their attractive inference properties.},

is supposed to combine elements from the three fields of engineering, data analysis and data administration.
Data administration skills are demanded to handle big data in diverse storage structures in data bases.
In order to extract knowledge from the stored data the proficient handling of data analysis tools - especially
machine learning - is essential. Finally, industrial domain knowledge is important to identify possible applications
for machine learning algorithms (and to interpret the results). However, to the best knowledge of the authors, an education program incorporating
elements of all three fields has not yet been established (in Germany).

In the context of the newly acquired project "Industrial Data Science" (InDaS) we aim to develop a qualification
concept for machine learning in industrial production targeted at two different groups. On the one hand advanced
students from any of the three fields mentioned above and on the other hand experienced professionals working in
industrial production. For the first group a one term lecture is going to be designed while coping with different
levels of knowledge in the inhomogeneous audience. It will be followed by a seminar with focus on use cases delivered
by partners from industrial production. Separately a workshop concept for the second target group will be developed
taking into account the strong domain knowledge of the participants.

The contents of the qualification concept should be selected according to the needs of industrial companies.
Therefore a survey was created to inquire the use and potentials of machine learning and the requirements for future
employees in industrial production. The evaluation of the survey and the resulting conclusions affecting the qualification
concept are going to be presented in this talk.},

      Problems ranging over probabilistic inference, planning, game theory, and numerical optimization have been tackled successfully using WMC technology.
      Weighted model integration (WMI) is a recent formalism generalizing WMC to the integration of functions over models of mixed discrete-continuous theories.
      WMI has already shown tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic programs.
      Yet, state of the art tools for WMI are nowhere as versatile as those for WMC--solvers are generally limited either by the range of amenable theories, or in terms of performance.
      Moreover, the data structures to represent, compose, and transform formulas over mixed theories have not reached the efficiency of their Boolean counterparts.
      Arguably, the latter is one of the prime reasons why WMC is so widely applicable.
      To address both limitations, we propose the use of extended algebraic decision diagrams (XADDs) as a compilation language for WMI.
      Aside from tackling typical WMI problems XADDs also enable partial WMI yielding parametrized solutions.
      To overcome the main roadblock of XADDs---the computational cost of variable elimination---we formulate a novel and powerful exact symbolic dynamic programming (SDP)
      algorithm that unlike its predecessor is able to effectively cache partial computations and seamlessly handle Boolean, integer-valued, and real variables.
      Our empirical results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can lead to an exponential to linear computational reduction in the best case and that it exceeds or
      matches state-of-the-art WMI solvers in terms of performance.

encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The
use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current
approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent
grasping points. The logic-based module receives data from a low-level
module that extracts semantic objects parts, and sends information to the low-level
grasp planner. These three modules define our probabilistic logic framework, which is

widely applied concept in modern robotics. Composing primitives
out of an existing library, however, has shown to be
a challenging problem. We propose the use of probabilistic
context-free grammars to sequence a series of primitives to
generate complex robot policies from a given library of primitives.
The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an
intuitive encoding of hierarchically and recursively structured
tasks. This hierarchical concept strongly connects with the way
robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However,
the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a
complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit
the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict
and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is
learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the
posteriors of the grammars given the observations. Restrictions

      Qualitative and quantitative assessment of pathogen development was used to explain changes in hyperspectral signatures.

      These changes could be linked to host plant modifications depending on individual host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Retrospective analysis of hyperspectral

  	Note = {Detecting anomalous activities from time series is critical for enhancing availability and security of systems in many domains. In real applications, the time series often arrive sequentially without fix length, and usually only a single scan is allowed through the data. In such situations, classical batch learning methods as well as retrospective segmentation methods would be less flexible for anomaly detection. Instead, we propose an online nonparametric Bayesian method OLAD for anomaly detection in streaming time series collected continuously. The method can effectively learn the underlying dynamics of anomaly-contaminated heavytailed time series and identify potential anomalous events. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.},

  	Note = {Numerical optimization is arguably the most prominent computational framework in machine learning and AI. It can be seen as an assembly language for hard combinatorial problems ranging from classification and regression in learning, to computing optimal policies and equilibria in decision theory, to entropy minimization in information sciences. Unfortunately, specifying such problems in complex domains involving relations, objects and other logical dependencies is cumbersome at best, requiring considerable expert knowledge, and solvers require models to be painstakingly reduced to standard forms. To overcome this, we introduce a rich modeling framework for optimization problems that allows convenient codification of symbolic structure. Rather than reducing this symbolic structure to a sparse or dense matrix, we represent and exploit it directly using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Combining efficient ADD-based matrix-vector algebra with a matrix-free interior-point method, we develop an engine that can fully leverage the structure of symbolic representations to solve convex linear and quadratic optimization problems. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.},

we introduce the concept of fractional symmetries of

many AI and machine learning approaches, and exploit it to
lift, i.e., to compress QPs. These lifted QPs can then be tackled
with the usual optimization toolbox (off-the-shelf solvers, cutting
plane algorithms, stochastic gradients etc.). If the original
QP exhibits symmetry, then the lifted one will generally be
more compact, and hence more efficient to solve.},

Two closely related inbred lines, differing in two quantitative trait loci (QTL), which made a difference in disease severity of 1.1--1.7 on the standard scoring scale (1--9), were investigated under controlled conditions. The temporal and spatial development of CLS lesions on the two genotypes were monitored using a hyperspectral microscope. The lesion development on the QTL-carrying, resistant genotype was characterised by a fast and abrupt change in spectral reflectance, whereas it was slower and ultimately more severe on the genotype lacking the QTL. An efficient approach for clustering of hyperspectral signatures was adapted in order to reveal resistance characteristics automatically. The presented method allowed a fast and reliable differentiation of CLS dynamics and lesion composition providing a promising tool to improve resistance breeding by objective and precise plant phenotyping.},

Here, we study shortest path length distributions. On the one hand, average as well as maximum distances can be determined therefrom; on the other hand, they are closely related to the dynamics of network spreading processes. Because of the combinatorial nature of networks, we apply maximum entropy arguments to derive a general, physically plausible model. In particular, we establish the generalized Gamma distribution as a continuous characterization of shortest path length histograms of networks or arbitrary topology.

Many successful approaches alleviate this problem by employing some form of distant supervision, i.e., look into knowledge bases such as Freebase as a source of supervision to create more examples. While this is perfectly reasonable, most distant supervision methods rely on a hand-coded background knowledge that explicitly looks for patterns in text. For example, they assume all sentences containing Person X and Person Y are positive examples of the relation married(X, Y). In this work, we take a different approach -- we infer weakly supervised examples for relations from models learned by using knowledge outside the natural language task. We argue that this method creates more robust examples that are particularly useful when learning the entire information-extraction model (the structure and parameters). We demonstrate on three domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to using distant supervision labels or a smaller set of gold-standard labels.},

This, in turn, paves the way to a wide range of commonly used analysis techniques that are based on measuring the similarities between data points using Euclidean distance. The resulting pipeline is fast. Within seconds first insights into plant data can be derived, even from non-labelled data.},

  	Note = {We propose relational linear programming, a simple framework for combing linear programs (LPs) and logic programs. A relational linear program (RLP) is a declarative LP template defining the objective and the constraints through the logical concepts of objects, relations, and quantified variables. This allows one to express the LP objective and constraints relationally for a varying number of individuals and relations among them without enumerating them. Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logical program consisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP. This ground LP is solved using lifted linear programming. That is, symmetries within the ground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the reduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. In contrast to mainstream LP template languages like AMPL, which features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a more intuitive representation of optimization problems over relational domains. We illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in Markov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision processes, and on collective inference using LP support vector machines.},

This has two benefits. First, off-the-shelf propagation schemes can be used to naturally construct kernels for many graph types, including labeled, partially labeled, unlabeled, directed, and attributed graphs. Second, by leveraging existing efficient and informative propagation schemes, propagation kernels can be considerably faster than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing predictive performance. We will also show that if the graphs at hand have a regular structure, for instance when modeling image or video data, one can exploit this regularity to scale the kernel computation to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes.

The probabilistic logic module makes use of object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories.

Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed GPC method using privileged noise, called GPC+, improves over a standard GPC without privileged knowledge, and also over the current state-of-the-art SVM-based method, SVM+.

We give a sufficient condition for R-convolution kernels that enables kernel computation by explicit mapping. We theoretically and experimentally analyze efficiency and flexibility of implicit kernel functions and dot products of explicitly computed feature maps for widely used graph kernels such as random walk kernels, sub graph matching kernels, and shortest-path kernels. For walk kernels we observe a phase transition when comparing runtime with respect to label diversity and walk lengths leading to the conclusion that explicit computations are only favourable for smaller label sets and walk lengths whereas implicit computation is superior for longer walk lengths and data sets with larger label diversity.},

Whereas Markov logic networks define distributions in terms of weighted formulae, RLR defines conditional probabilities in terms of weighted formulae. They agree for the supervised learning case when all variables except a query leaf variable are observed. However, they are quite different in representing distributions. The KR-2014 paper defined the RLR formalism, defined canonical forms for RLR in terms of positive conjunctive (or disjunctive) formulae, indicated the class of conditional probability distributions that can and cannot be represented by RLR, and defined many other aggregators in terms of RLR. In this paper, we summarize these results and compare RLR to Markov logic networks.},

In this paper, we set out a novel pipeline that uses volumetric MRI data collected from different subjects as input and classifies them into one of three classes: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN). Our pipeline consists of three stages---(1) a segmentation layer where brain MRI data is divided into clinically relevant regions; (2) a classification layer that uses relational learning algorithms to make pairwise predictions between the three classes; and (3) a combination layer that combines the results of the different classes to obtain the final classification. One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers. We evaluate our pipeline on 397 patients acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate that it obtains state-of-the-art performance with minimal feature engineering.},

But perhaps more important is that we are able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the migration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not memoryless but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to make k>1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that migration at later career stages is memoryless. This aligns well but actually goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education and research worldwide.},

Today's datasets from longitudinal studies offer great promise to uncover these interactions but also pose enormous analytical problems due to typically large amount of both discrete and continuous measurements and risk factors with potential long-range interactions over time. Our investigation demonstrates that a statistical relational analysis of longitudinal data can easily uncover complex interactions of risks factors and actually predict future coronary artery calcification (CAC) levels --- an indicator of the risk of CHD present subclinically in an individual --- significantly better than traditional non-relational approaches. The uncovered long-range interactions between risk factors conform to existing clinical knowledgeand are successful in identifying risk factors at the early adult stage.

Spectral data cubes were analysed by extracting specific spectral signatures of disease symptoms during pathogenesis. Spectral patterns were observed with high resolution in time and space. Advanced data mining methods were used for the differentiation and quantification of diseased leaf tissue. An effective and automatic image analysis approach has been established by now.

The ``response turning time-point'' in the temporal curve of plant response to stress rather than the maxima is the most relevant time-point for guided sampling to get insights into mechanistic basis of plant response to drought stress. Comparative hyperspectral image analysis was performed on barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants grown under well-watered and water stress conditions in two consecutive years. The obtained massive, high-dimensional data cubes were analysed with a recent matrix factorization technique based on simplex volume maximization of hyperspectral data and compared to several drought-related traits.

Typical ways to address this scaling issue are inference by approximate message passing, stochastic gradients, and MapReduce, among others. Often, we encounter inference and training problems with symmetries and redundancies in the graph structure. It has been shown that inference and training can indeed benefit from exploiting symmetries, for example by lifting loopy belief propagation (LBP).That is, a model is compressed by grouping nodes together that send and receive identical messages so that a modified LBP running on the lifted graph yields the same marginals as LBP on the original one, but often in a fraction of time. By establishing a link between lifting and radix sort, we show that lifting is MapReduce-able and thus combine the two orthogonal approaches to scaling inference, namely exploiting symmetries and employing parallel computations.},

The key innovation is that this commonsense knowledge is completely independent of the natural language text. This helps when learning the full model for information extraction as against simply learning the parameters of a known CRF or MLN.

Social networking and content sharing sites seem to hold the key to the integration of context and semantics into image analysis. In this paper, we explore the use of social media in this regard. We present empirical results obtained on a set of 127,593 images with 3,741,176 tag assignments that were harvested from Flickr, a photo sharing site. We report on how users tag and rate photos and present an approach towards automatically recognizing the aesthetic appeal of images using confidence-based classifiers to alleviate effects due to ambiguously labeled data. Our results indicate that user generated content allows for learning about aesthetic appeal. In particular, established low-level image features seem to enable the recognition of beauty. A reliable recognition of unseemliness, on the other hand, appears to require more elaborate high-level analysis.},

By establishing a link between lifting and radix sort, we show that lifting is MapReduce-able. Still, in many if not most situations training relational models will not benefit from this (scalable) lifting: symmetries within models easily break since variables become correlated by virtue of depending asymmetrically on evidence. An appealing idea for such situations is to train and recombine local models. This breaks long-range dependencies and allows to exploit lifting within and across the local training tasks.

Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents. Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

Pre-symptomatic water stress detection is of particular interest, ultimately helping to meet the challenge of ``How to feed a hungry world?''. Due to the climate change, this is of considerable political and public interest. Due to its large-scale and temporal nature, e.g., when monitoring plants using hyper-spectral imaging, and the demand of physical meaning of the results, it presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability. However, big data matrices over time also arise in several other real-life applications such as stock market monitoring where a business sector is characterized by the ups and downs of each of its companies per year or topic monitoring of document collections. Therefore, we consider the general problem of embedding data matrices into Euclidean space over time without making any assumption on the generating distribution of each matrix. To do so, we represent all data samples by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time. On the simplex spanned by the extremes, there are then natural candidates for distributions inducing distances between and in turn embeddings of the data matrices. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic, text, and financial data as well as a large-scale dataset on water stress detection in plants with more than 3 billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that the embeddings are meaningful and fast to compute. The stress detection results were validated by a domain expert and conform to existing plant physiological knowledge.

  	Note = {Low-rank approximations which are computed from selected rows and columns of a given data matrix have attracted considerable attention lately. They have been proposed as an alternative to the SVD because they naturally lead to interpretable decompositions which was shown to be successful in application such as fraud detection, fMRI segmentation, and collaborative filtering. The CUR decomposition of large matrices, for example, samples rows and columns according to a probability distribution that depends on the Euclidean norm of rows or columns or on other measures of statistical leverage. At the same time, there are various deterministic approaches that do not resort to sampling and were found to often yield factorization of superior quality with respect to reconstruction accuracy. However, these are hardly applicable to large matrices as they typically suffer from high computational costs. Consequently, many practitioners in the field of data mining have abandon deterministic approaches in favor of randomized ones when dealing with today's large-scale data sets. In this paper, we empirically disprove this prejudice. We do so by introducing a novel, linear-time, deterministic CUR approach that adopts the recently introduced Simplex Volume Maximization approach for column selection. The latter has already been proven to be successful for NMF-like decompositions of matrices of billions of entries. Our exhaustive empirical study on more than 30 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrates that it is also beneficial for CUR-like decompositions. Compared to other deterministic CUR-like methods, it provides comparable reconstruction quality but operates much faster so that it easily scales to matrices of billions of elements. Compared to sampling-based methods, it provides competitive reconstruction quality while staying in the same run-time complexity class.},

However, this na¨ıve solution cannot make use of standard solvers for linear equations and is doomed to construct lifted networks in each iteration of the interior-point method again, an operation that can itself be quite costly. To address both issues, we show how to read off an equivalent LP from the lifted GaBP computations that can be solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. We prove the correctness of this compilation approac and experimentally demonstrate that it can greatly reduce the cost of solving LPs.},

In order to effciently extract graph features from continuous node label distributions, and in general from continuous vector-valued node attributes, we utilize randomized techniques, which easily allow for deriving similarity measures based on propagated information.

When applied to game telemetry data, pattern recognition and statistical analysis provide valuable business intelligence tools for game development. An important problem in this area is to characterize how player engagement in a game evolves over time. Reliable models are of pivotal interest since they allow for assessing the long-term success of game products and can provide estimates of how long players may be expected to keep actively playing a game. In this paper, we introduce methods from random process theory into game data mining in order to draw inferences about player engagement. Given large samples (over 250,000 players) of behavioral telemetry data from five different action-adventure and shooter games, we extract information as to how long individual players have played these games and apply techniques from lifetime analysis to identify common patterns. In all five cases, we find that the Weibull distribution gives a good account of the statistics of total playing times. This implies that an average player's interest in playing one of the games considered evolves according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Therefore, given data on the initial playtime behavior of the players of a game, it becomes possible to predict when they stop playing.},

  	Note = {Point-based value iteration (PBVI) methods have proven extremely effective for finding (approximately) optimal dynamic programming solutions to partiallyobservable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) when a set of initial belief states is known. However, no PBVI work has provided exact point-based backups for both continuous state and observation spaces, which we tackle in this paper. Our key insight is that while there may be an infinite number of observations, there are only a finite number of continuous observation partitionings that are relevant for optimal decision-making when a finite, fixed set of reachable belief states is considered. To this end, we make two important contributions: (1) we show how previous exact symbolic dynamic programming solutions for continuous state MDPs can be generalized to continuous state POMDPs with discrete observations, and (2) we show how recently developed symbolic integration methods allow this solution to be extended to PBVI for continuous state and observation POMDPs with potentially correlated, multivariate continuous observation spaces.},

In this paper, we set out a novel pipeline that uses volumetric MRI data collected from different subjects as input and classifies them into one of three classes: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN). Our pipeline consists of three stages -- (1) a segmentation layer where brain MRI data is divided into clinically relevant regions; (2) a classification layer that uses relational learning algorithms to make pairwise predictions between the three classes; and (3) a combination layer that combines the results of the different classes to obtain the final classification. One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers. We evaluate our pipeline on 397 patients acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate that it obtains state-oft-he-art performance with minimal feature engineering.},

Quickly learning such codes typically boils down to principle component analysis (PCA). However, this is only justified for normally distributed data. For proportional data (normalized histograms), this is not the case. Due to the sum-to-unity constraint, features that are as independent as possible will not all be uncorrelated. In this paper, we show that a linear-time transformation efficiently copes with sum-to-unity constraints: first, we select a small number K of diverse data points by maximizing the volume of the simplex spanned by these prototypes; second, we represent each data point by means of its cosine similarities to the K selected prototypes. This maximum volume hashing is sensible since each dimension in the transformed space is likely to follow a von Mises (vM) distribution, and, in very high dimensions, the vM distribution closely resembles a Gaussian distribution. This justifies to employ PCA on the transformed data. Our extensive experiments validate this: maximum volume hashing outperforms spectral hashing and other state of the art techniques.},

Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents. Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

Whereas current learning approaches for RDNs learn a single probability tree per random variable, we propose to turn the problem into a series of relational function-approximation problems using gradient-based boosting. In doing so, one can easily induce highly complex features over several iterations and in turn estimate quickly a very expressive model.

Classical supervised learning algorithms often fail in applied plant sciences due to their need of labelled datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Therefore, new approaches for unsupervised learning of relevant patterns are needed. We apply for the first time a recent matrix factorisation technique, simplex volume maximisation (SiVM), to hyperspectral data. It is an unsupervised classification approach, optimised for fast computation of massive datasets. It allows calculation of how similar each spectrum is to observed typical spectra. This provides the means to express how likely it is that one plant is suffering from stress. The method was tested for drought stress, applied to potted barley plants in a controlled rain-out shelter experiment and to agricultural corn plots subjected to a two factorial field setup altering water and nutrient availability. Both experiments were conducted on the canopy level. SiVM was significantly better than using a combination of established vegetation indices. In the corn plots, SiVM clearly separated the different treatments, even though the effects on leaf and canopy traits were subtle.},

Efficient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efficiency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efficient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.},

Although, a very first link between both fields has been established already in the early 90ies, many recent papers on mobility mining seem to be unaware of it. We therefore revisit the link and show that many unexplored and novel mobility mining methods fall naturally out of it. Specifically, using advanced discretization techniques for stay-point detection and map matching, we turn traffic sequences into a biological ones. Then, we introduce a novel distance function that enables us to directly apply the rich toolbox for biological sequence analysis to it. For instance, by just looking at co mplex traffic data through the biological glasses of sequence logos we get a novel, easy-to-grasp visualization of data, called Traffic Logos. For clustering and prediction tasks, our empirical evaluation on three real-world data sets demonstrates that revisiting the link can yield performance as good as state-of-the-art data mining techniques.},

Specifically, we compute an initial ranking using personalized PageRank. Then, we find paths of atoms that are connected via their arguments, variablize the ground atoms in each path, in order to create features for the query. These features are used to re-personalize the original RWR and to finally compute the set completion, based on Label Propagation. Moreover, we exploit that RWR techniques can naturally be lifted and show that lifted inference for label propagation is possible. We evaluate our algorithm on a realworld relational dataset by finding completions of sets of objects describing the Roman city of Pompeii. We compare to Bayesian sets and show that our approach gives very reasonable set completions.},

They do, however, not prescribe a way to solve more complex inference tasks such as computing joint marginals for k-tuples of distant random variables or satisfying assignments of CNFs. A popular solution in these cases is the idea of turning the complex inference task into a sequence of simpler ones by selecting and clamping variables one at a time and running lifted message passing again after each selection. This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference. We show how to avoid this by efficiently computing the lifted network for each conditioning directly from the one already known for the single node marginals. Our experiments show that significant efficiency gains are possible for lifted message passing guided decimation for SAT and sampling.},

For propositional worlds, functional gradient methods have been proved to be beneficial. They are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient, more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the form of the function. Building on recent generalizations of functional gradient boosting to relational representations, we implement a functional gradient boosting approach to imitation learning in relational domains. In particular, given a set of traces from the human teacher, our system learns a policy in the form of a set of relational regression trees that additively approximate the functional gradients. The use of multiple additive trees combined with relational representation allows for learning more expressive policies than what has been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in several different domains.},

Current methods for learning MLNs follow a twostep approach: first, perform a search through the space of possible clauses and then learn appropriate weights for these clauses. We propose to take a different approach, namely to learn both the weights and the structure of the MLN simultaneously. Our approach is based on functional gradient boosting where the problem of learning MLNs is turned into a series of relational functional approximation problems. We use two kinds of representations for the gradients: clausebased and tree-based. Our experimental evaluation on several benchmark data sets demonstrates that our new approach can learn MLNs as good or better than those found with state-ofthe-art methods, but often in a fraction of the time.},

  	Note = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

Previous work has developed a set of operations for composition and for removing redundancies in FODDs, thus keeping them compact, and showed how to successfully employ FODDs for solving large-scale stochastic planning problems through the formalism of relational Markov decision processes (RMDP). In this paper, we introduce several new ideas enhancing the applicability of FODDs. More specifically, we first introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and composition operations for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we develop a novel approach for reducing (G)FODDs using model checking. This yields -- for the first time -- a reduction that maximally reduces the diagram for the FODD case and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs. Finally we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a complete solution for the case where the reward function is specified using an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers.},

In this work, we show that it is also possible to exploit the full expressive power of first-order quantification to achieve state, action, and observation abstraction in a dynamic programming solution to relationally specified POMDPs. Among the advantages of this approach are the ability to maintain compact value function representations, abstract over the space of potentially optimal actions, and automatically derive compact conditional policy trees that minimally partition relational observation spaces according to distinctions that have an impact on policy values. This is the first lifted relational POMDP solution that can optimally accommodate actions with a potentially infinite relational space of observation outcomes.},

We demonstrate this idea by introducing novel model-checking reduction operations for First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a representation that has been used to implement decision-theoretic planning with Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP). Intuitively, these reductions modify the construction of the value function by removing any complex specifications that are irrelevant to the set of training examples, thereby focusing on the region of interest. We show that such training examples can be constructed on the fly from a description of the planning problem thus we can bootstrap to get a self-taught planning system. Additionally, we provide a new heuristic to embed universal and conjunctive goals within the framework of RMDP planners, expanding the scope and applicability of such systems. We show that these ideas lead to significant improvements in performance in terms of both speed and coverage of the planner, yielding state of the art planning performance on problems from the International Planning Competition.},

This paper focuses on designing such a navigation system for image browsers. This is a challenging task because arbitrary layout structure makes it difficult -- if not impossible -- to compute cross-similarities between images and structure coordinates, the main ingredient of traditional layouting approaches. For this reason, we resort to a recently developed machine learning technique: kernelized sorting. It is a general technique for matching pairs of objects from different domains without requiring cross-domain similarity measures and hence elegantly allows sorting images into arbitrary structures. Moreover, we extend it so that some images can be preselected for instance forming the tip of the hierarchy allowing to subsequently navigate through the search results in the lower levels in an intuitive way.},

While it was already shown that active learning can effectively reduce the number of training pairs needed, the most successful existing algorithms cannot generalize over items or queries. Considering web search as an example, they would need to learn a separate relevance score for each document-query pair from scratch. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose a link-based active preference learning method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) that incorporates dependency information from both feature-vector representations as well as relations. Specifically, to meet the requirement on computational efficiency of active exploration, we introduce a novel incremental update method that scales as well as the non-generalizing models.

  	Note = {Segmenting range data into semantic categories has become a more and more active field of research in robotics. In this paper, we advocate to view this task as a problem of fast, large-scale retrieval. Intuitively, given a dataset of millions of labeled scan points and their neighborhoods, we simply search for similar points in the datasets and use the labels of the retrieved ones to predict the labels of a novel point using some local prediction model such as majority vote or logistic regression. However, actually carrying this out requires highly efficient ways of (1) storing millions of scan points in memory and (2) quickly finding similar scan points to a target scan point. In this paper, we propose to address both issues by employing Weiss et al.'s recent spectral hashing. It represents each item in a database by a compact binary code that is constructed so that similar items will have similar binary code words. In turn, similar neighbors have codes within a small Hamming distance of the code for the query. Then, we learn a logistic regression model locally over all points with the same binary code word. Our experiments on real world 3D scans show that the resulting approach, called spectrally hashed logistic regression, can be ultra fast at prediction time and outperforms state-of-the art approaches such as logistic regression and nearest neighbor.},

CH-NMF factorizes a non-negative data matrix V into two nonnegative matrix factors V ≈ W H such that the columns of W are convex combinations of certain data points so that they are readily interpretable to data analysts. There is, however, no free lunch: imposing convexity constraints on W typically prevents adaptation to intrinsic, low dimensional structures in the data. Alas, in cases where the data is distributed in a non-convex manner or consists of mixtures of lower dimensional convex distributions, the cluster representatives obtained from CH-NMF will be less meaningful. In this paper, we present a hierarchical CH-NMF that automatically adapts to internal structures of a dataset, hence it yields meaningful and interpretable clusters for non-convex datasets. This is also confirmed by our extensive evaluation on DBLP publication records of 760,000 authors, 4,000,000 images harvested from the web, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft guilds.},

Surprisingly, kernel methods have not received attention yet although they are very popular in the machine learning community due to their solid mathematical foundation, tendency toward easy geometric interpretation, and strong empirical performance in a wide variety of domains. In this paper, we show how to employ kernels for map matching. Specifically, ignoring map constraints, we first maximize the consistency between the similarity measures captured by the kernel matrices of the trajectory and relevant part of the street map. The resulting relaxed assignment is then ''rounded'' into a hard assignment fulfilling the map constraints.

Recently, lifted belief propagation (LBP) has been proposed as an efficient approximate solution of this inference problem. It runs a modified BP on a lifted network where nodes have been grouped together if they have --- roughly speaking --- identical computation trees, the tree-structured unrolling of the underlying graph rooted at the nodes. In many situations, this purely syntactic criterion is too pessimistic: message errors decay along paths. Intuitively, for a long chain graph with weak edge potentials, distant nodes will send and receive identical messages yet their computation trees are quite different. To overcome this, we propose iLBP, a novel, easy-to-implement, informed LBP approach that interleaves lifting and modified BP iterations. In turn, we can efficiently monitor the true BP messages sent and received in each iteration and group nodes accordingly. As our experiments show, iLBP can yield significantly faster more lifted network while not degrading performance. Above all, we show that iLBP is faster than BP when solving the problem of distributing data to a large network, an important real-world application where BP is faster than uninformed LBP.},

Nevertheless, it can induce severe mechanical stress to the lung, which generally impairs the outcome of the therapy. To reduce the risk of a ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), lung protective ventilation is essential, especially for patients with a previous medical history like the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The prerequisite for lung protective ventilation approaches is the knowledge about the physical behavior of the human lung under the condition of mechanical ventilation. This knowledge is commonly described by mathematical models. Diverse models have been introduced to represent particular aspects of mechanical characteristics of the lung. A commonly accepted general model is the equation of motion, which relates the airway pressure to the airflow and the volume applied by the ventilator and describes the influence of the distensibility and resistance of the respiratory system. Equation Discovery systems extract mathematical models from observed time series data. To reduce the vast search space associated with this task, the LAGRAMGE-system introduced the application of declarative bias in Equation Discovery, which furthermore allows the presentation of domain specific knowledge. We introduce a modification of this system and apply it to data obtained during mechanical ventilation of ARDS-patients. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that the equation of motion model can automatically be rediscovered from real-world data.},

In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for the factorization of gigantic matrices that iteratively yields latent components. We consider a constrained matrix factorization s.t.~the latent components form a simplex that encloses most of the remaining data. The algorithm maximizes the volume of that simplex and thereby reduces the displacement of data from the space spanned by the latent components. Hence, it also lowers the Frobenius norm, a common criterion for matrix factorization quality. Our algorithm is efficient, well-grounded in distance geometry, and easily applicable to matrices with billions of entries. In addition, the resulting factors allow for an intuitive interpretation of data: every data point can now be expressed as a convex combination of the most extreme and thereby often most descriptive instances in a collection of data. Extensive experimental validations on web-scale data, including 80 million images and 1.5 million twitter tweets, demonstrate superior performance compared to related factorization or clustering techniques.},

In an IHRM-based social network model, each edge is associated with a random variable and the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables are specified by the model, based on the relational structure. The hidden variables, one for each object, are able to transport information such that non-local probabilistic dependencies can be obtained. The model can be used to predict entity attributes, to predict relationships between entities and it performs an interpretable cluster analysis. We demonstrate the performance of IHRMs with three social network applications. We perform community analysis on the Sampson's monastery data and perform link analysis on the Bernard & Killworth data. Finally we apply IHRMs to the MovieLens data for prediction of user preference on movies and for an analysis of user clusters and movie clusters.},

Previous work developed a set of operations over FODDs, showed how they can be used to solve relational Markov decision processes (RMDP) using dynamic programming algorithms, and demonstrated their success in solving stochastic planning problems from the International Planning Competition in the system FODD-Planner. A crucial ingredient of this scheme is a set of operations to remove redundancy in decision diagrams, thus keeping them compact. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and combination algorithms for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a particularly promising case where an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers is followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers. Third, we develop a new approach to reduce FODDs and GFODDs using model checking. This yields a reduction that is complete for FODDs and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs.},

  	Note = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

Specifically, we propose stacked Gaussian process learning, a meta-learning scheme in which a base Gaus- sian process is enhanced by adding the posterior covariance functions of other related tasks to its covariance function in a stage-wise optimization. The idea is that the stacked posterior covariances encode the hidden common causes among variables of interest that are shared across the related regression tasks. Stacked Gaussian process learning is efficient, capable of capturing shared common causes, and can be implemented with any kind of standard Gaussian process regression model such as sparse approximations and relational variants. Our experimental results on real-world data from the market relevant application show that stacked Gaussian processes learning can significantly improve prediction performance of a standard Gaussian process.},

The major benefit of our approach is its ability to generalize over entire range scans directly. This way, we can learn the distributions of range measurements for whole regions of the robot's configuration space from only few recorded or simulated range scans. Especially in approximative approaches to state estimation like particle filtering or histogram filtering, this leads to a better approximation of the true likelihood function.

A valid analysis of respiratory mechanics is a prerequisite for lung protective ventilation. This analysis is always based on mathematical models. The equation of motion defines a generally accepted model of the respiratory system. It relates the airway pressure to the ventilator induced airflow and volume application influenced by distensibility and resistance of the respiratory system. We present a novel equation discovery system which combines the technique of using declarative bias for the reduction of the vast search space known from the LAGRAMGE-system with a greedy, randomized search strategy according to GSAT. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that the equation of motion model can automatically be rediscovered from real-world data.},

We propose a novel acceleration called SCGEM based on scaled conjugate gradients (SCGs) well-known from learning neural networks. SCGEM avoids the line search by adopting the scaling mechanism of SCGs applied to the expected information matrix. This guarantees a single likelihood evaluation per iteration. We empirically compare SCGEM with EM and conventional conjugate gradient accelerated EM. The experiments show that SCGEM can significantly accelerate both of them and is equal in quality.},

In the study, we compared different methods of measuring pressure--volume curves in artificially ventilated patients suffering from the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our aim was to show that inductive machine learning can be used to gain insights into differences and similarities among these methods. We defined two tasks: the first one was to recognize the measurement method producing a given pressure--volume curve. This was defined as the task of classifying pressure--volume curves (the classes being the measurement methods). The second was to model the curves themselves, that is, to predict the volume given the pressure, the measurement method and the patient data. Clearly, this can be defined as a regression task. For these two tasks, we applied C5.0 and CUBIST, two inductive machine learning tools, respectively. Apart from medical findings regarding the characteristics of the measurement methods, we found some evidence showing the value of an abstract representation for classifying curves: normalization and high-level descriptors from curve fitting played a crucial role in obtaining reasonably accurate models. Another useful feature of algorithms for inductive machine learning is the possibility of incorporating background knowledge. In our study, the incorporation of patient data helped to improve regression results dramatically, which might open the door for the individual respiratory treatment of patients in the future.},

In order to represent objects and relations it combines Bayesian networks with definite clause logic by establishing a one-to-one mapping between ground atoms and random variables. We show that Bayesian logic programs combine the advantages of both definite clause logic and Bayesian networks. This includes the separation of quantitative and qualitative aspects of the model.
