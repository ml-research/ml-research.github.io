        Combining deep classifiers with knowledge expressed in the form of rules and constraints
        allows one to leverage different forms of abstractions within argumentation mining.
        Argumentation for ma-chine learning can yield argumentation-based learning methods where the
        machine and the user argue about the learned model with the common goal of providing results of
         maximum utility to the user. Unfortunately, both directions are currently rather challenging.
         For instance, combining deep neural models with logic typically only yields determinisic
         results, while combining probabilistic models with logic often results in intractable
         inference. Therefore, we review a novel deep but tractable model for conditional probability
         distributions  that  can  harness  the  expressive  power  of universal  function  approximators
         such  as  neural  networks while still maintaining a wide range of tractable inference routines.
         While this new model has shown appealing performance in classification tasks, humans cannot
         easily under-stand the reasons for its decision. Therefore, we also review our recent efforts
         on how to “argue” with deep models. On synthetic and real data we illustrate how “arguing”
         with a deep model about its explanations can actually help to revise the model, if it is
         right for the wrong reasons. We only sketch and review our recent efforts. More details can be

    Note = {Allowing machines to choose whether to kill humans would be devastating for world peace and security. But how do we equip
machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? In this study, we show that applying machine learning to human
texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about ``right" and ``wrong" conduct.
We create a template list of prompts and responses, such as ``Should I [action]?'', ``Is it okay to [action]?'', etc. with corresponding
answers of ``Yes/no, I should (not).'' and "Yes/no, it is (not)." The model's bias score is now the difference between the model's
score of the positive response (``Yes, I should'') and that of the negative response (``No, I should not''). For a given choice, the
model's overall bias score is the mean of the bias scores of all question/answer templates paired with that choice.
Specifically, the resulting model, called the Moral Choice Machine (MCM), calculates the bias score on a sentence level using
embeddings of the Universal Sentence Encoder since the moral value of an action to be taken depends on its context. It is
objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time. It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt. It is important to
spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation.
Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our social, ethical and moral choices, even
with context information. Actually, training the Moral Choice Machine on different temporal news and book corpora from year
1510 to 2008/09 demonstrate the evolution of moral and ethical choices over different time periods for both atomic actions and
actions with context information. By training it on different cultural sources such as the Bible and the constitution of different
countries, dynamics of moral choices in culture, including technology are revealed. That is the fact that moral biases can be
extracted, quantified, tracked, and compared across cultures and over time.},

  learn a pure data-driven model which learns the basic characteristics of a given database. As a result, our data-driven approach not only
  supports ad-hoc queries but also updates of the data without the need to retrain when the workload or data changes.
  Indeed, one may expect that this comes at a price of lower accuracy since workload-driven models can make use of more information.

distributions defined via deep neural networks. The resulting systems allow relational probabilistic
models with deep components to be trained end-to-end. However, in this setting, deep models are
used purely as conditional density estimators. This limits the types of inferences that are possible
in the resulting system: Lacking any model for the inputs of the neural network, missing values
can not be inferred or sampled. To overcome these obstacles we propose a novel
deep relational probabilistic PL — "SPLog: Sum-Product Logic", the main components of which
are Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and ProbLog. SPNs are a type of
deep generative model with the crucial property that all conditional and marginal queries may be
answered exactly in linear time. In this extended abstract, we show how to leverage this feature in

tasks remotely on sensitive client data in a privacy-preserving way: the server learns nothing about the input data and the model predictions,
while the client learns nothing about the ML model (which is often considered intellectual property and might contain traces
of sensitive data). While such privacy-preserving solutions are relatively efficient, they are mostly targeted at neural networks, can
degrade the predictive accuracy, and usually reveal the network’s topology. Furthermore, existing solutions are not readily accessible
to ML experts, as prototype implementations are not well-integrated into ML frameworks and require extensive cryptographic knowledge.
In this paper, we present CryptoSPN, a framework for privacypreserving inference of sum-product networks (SPNs). SPNs are a
tractable probabilistic graphical model that allows a range of exact inference queries in linear time. Specifically, we show how to

             collections of bipartite matrices which represent how players’ interests and behaviors change over time. Extensive online bucket
             type tests during the ongoing operation of a commercial game reveal that our system is able to recommend more engaging quests and to
             retain more players than previous handcrafted or collaborative filtering approaches.},

values, the required arithmetic precision poses different challenges than those encountered with Neural Networks. In previous
work, this precision was maintained by using double-precision floating-point number formats, which are expensive to implement
in FPGAs. In this work, we propose the use of a logarithmic number scale format tailored specifically towards the inference in Sum-
Product Networks. The evaluation of our optimized arithmetic hardware operators shows that the use of logarithmic number

    But how do we equip machines with the ability to learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed
    that applying machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning about "right" and "wrong"
    conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is
    objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it
    is important to spread information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated moral bias was restricted
    to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa
    and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass?
    In this paper, we discuss and show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language representations also improve
    the representation of the underlying ethical and moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic representation
    of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral
    Choice Machine (MCM) to extract more accurate imprints of moral choices and ethical values.},

The AIR model expresses the composition of visual scenes from individual objects, and uses variational autoencoders to model the appearance of those objects.
However, inference in the overall model is highly intractable, which hampers its learning speed and makes it prone to sub-optimal solutions.
In this paper, we show that inference and learning in AIR can be considerably accelerated by replacing the intractable object representations with tractable probabilistic models.
In particular, we opt for sum-product (SP) networks, an expressive deep probabilistic model with a rich set of tractable inference routines.
As our empirical evidence shows, the resulting model, called SuPAIR, achieves a higher object detection accuracy than the original AIR system, while reducing the learning time by an order of magnitude.
Moreover, SuPAIR allows one to treat object occlusions in a consistent manner and to include a background noise model, improving the robustness of Bayesian scene understanding.},

Since, in discrete domains, ACs are essentially equivalent to mixtures of trees, DACBOOST decomposes
a large AC into smaller tree-structured ACs and learns them in a sequential, additive
manner. The resulting non-parametric manner of learning the DACs results in a model with very
few tuning parameters making our learned model significantly more efficient. We demonstrate on
standard data sets and some real-world data sets, the efficiency of DACBOOST compared to the
state-of-the-art DAC learners without sacrificing the effectiveness. This makes it possible to employ
DACs for large scale real-world tasks.},

In the past years, the database community has been working on different techniques for Approximate Query Processing (AQP) that aim to deliver an approximate query result given a fixed time bound to support interactive visualizations better. However, classical AQP approaches suffer from various problems that limit the applicability to support the ad-hoc exploration of a new data set: (1) Classical AQP approaches that perform online sampling can support ad-hoc exploration queries but yield low quality if executed over rare subpopulations. (2) Classical AQP approaches that rely on offline sampling can use some form of biased sampling to mitigate these problems but require a priori knowledge of the workload, which is often not realistic if users want to explore a new database. In this paper, we present a new approach to AQP called Model-based AQP that leverages generative models learned over the complete database to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds. Different from classical AQP approaches, generative models allow us to compute responses to ad-hoc queries and deliver high-quality estimates also over rare subpopulations at the same time. In our experiments with real and synthetic data sets, we show that Model-based AQP can in many scenarios return more accurate results in a shorter runtime. Furthermore, we think that our techniques of using generative models presented in this paper can not only be used for AQP in databases but also has applications for other database problems including Query Optimization as well as Data Cleaning.},

  Note = {Probabilistic models provide a framework for describing abstract prior knowledge and using it to reason under uncertainty. Deep probabilistic programming languages (PPL) are a powerful tool to ease the development of probabilistic models. They let users specify generative probabilistic models as programs and then ``compile'' those models down into inference procedures. Since probabilistic inference is still intractable, existing deep PPLs leverage deep learning for inference. The key idea is to describe inference via a second model called an inference model trained in variational fashion. Both the generative and the inference models can include deep neural networks as components.
While the details of the employed neural architectures may differ, they typically model distributions only implicitly, i.e., they allow for sampling but not the computation of marginal probabilities.
This extended abstract makes the case to not "go down the full neural road", but to explicitly obtain uncertainties in an arithmetic circuit manner. To this end, sum-product networks (SPNs) are a promising option, as they are a class of probabilistic model which permit explicit uncertainties and efficient inference.
More precisely, SPNs can compute any marginalization and conditioning query in time linear of the model's representation size. Although SPNs can be described in a nutshell as "deep mixture models", they have received no attention in the deep PPL community, despite their attractive inference properties.},

for specially educated data-oriented professionals in industrial production. The education of such specialists
is supposed to combine elements from the three fields of engineering, data analysis and data administration.
Data administration skills are demanded to handle big data in diverse storage structures in data bases.
In order to extract knowledge from the stored data the proficient handling of data analysis tools - especially
machine learning - is essential. Finally, industrial domain knowledge is important to identify possible applications
for machine learning algorithms (and to interpret the results). However, to the best knowledge of the authors, an education program incorporating
elements of all three fields has not yet been established (in Germany).

In the context of the newly acquired project "Industrial Data Science" (InDaS) we aim to develop a qualification
concept for machine learning in industrial production targeted at two different groups. On the one hand advanced
students from any of the three fields mentioned above and on the other hand experienced professionals working in
industrial production. For the first group a one term lecture is going to be designed while coping with different
levels of knowledge in the inhomogeneous audience. It will be followed by a seminar with focus on use cases delivered
by partners from industrial production. Separately a workshop concept for the second target group will be developed
taking into account the strong domain knowledge of the participants.

The contents of the qualification concept should be selected according to the needs of industrial companies.
Therefore a survey was created to inquire the use and potentials of machine learning and the requirements for future
employees in industrial production. The evaluation of the survey and the resulting conclusions affecting the qualification
concept are going to be presented in this talk.},

      Problems ranging over probabilistic inference, planning, game theory, and numerical optimization have been tackled successfully using WMC technology.
      Weighted model integration (WMI) is a recent formalism generalizing WMC to the integration of functions over models of mixed discrete-continuous theories.
      WMI has already shown tremendous promise for solving inference problems in graphical models and probabilistic programs.
      Yet, state of the art tools for WMI are nowhere as versatile as those for WMC--solvers are generally limited either by the range of amenable theories, or in terms of performance.
      Moreover, the data structures to represent, compose, and transform formulas over mixed theories have not reached the efficiency of their Boolean counterparts.
      Arguably, the latter is one of the prime reasons why WMC is so widely applicable.
      To address both limitations, we propose the use of extended algebraic decision diagrams (XADDs) as a compilation language for WMI.
      Aside from tackling typical WMI problems XADDs also enable partial WMI yielding parametrized solutions.
      To overcome the main roadblock of XADDs---the computational cost of variable elimination---we formulate a novel and powerful exact symbolic dynamic programming (SDP)
      algorithm that unlike its predecessor is able to effectively cache partial computations and seamlessly handle Boolean, integer-valued, and real variables.
      Our empirical results demonstrate that the improved algorithm can lead to an exponential to linear computational reduction in the best case and that it exceeds or
      matches state-of-the-art WMI solvers in terms of performance.

provides the robot with semantic reasoning skills about the most likely object part to be

is task-dependent. It semantically reasons about pre-grasp configurations with respect
to the intended task and employs object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to
encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The
use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current
approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent
grasping points. The logic-based module receives data from a low-level
module that extracts semantic objects parts, and sends information to the low-level
grasp planner. These three modules define our probabilistic logic framework, which is

The rule-based nature of formal grammars allows an

robot policies can be learned, organized, and re-used. However,
the induction of context-free grammars has proven to be a
complicated and yet unsolved challenge. In this work, we exploit
the physical nature of robot movement primitives to restrict
and efficiently search the grammar space. The grammar is
learned with Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization over the
posteriors of the grammars given the observations. Restrictions
over operators connecting the search define the corresponding
proposal distributions and, therefore, guide the optimization
additionally. In experiments, we validate our method on a
redundant 7 degree-of-freedom lightweight robotic arm on tasks

It can be seen as an assembly language for hard combinatorial problems ranging from classification and regression in learning, to computing optimal policies and equilibria in decision theory, to entropy minimization in information sciences. Unfortunately, specifying such problems in complex domains involving relations, objects and other logical dependencies is cumbersome at best, requiring considerable expert knowledge, and solvers require models to be painstakingly reduced to standard forms. To overcome this, we introduce a rich modeling framework for optimization problems that allows convenient codification of symbolic structure. Rather than reducing this symbolic structure to a sparse or dense matrix, we represent and exploit it directly using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Combining efficient ADD-based matrix-vector algebra with a matrix-free interior-point method, we develop an engine that can fully leverage the structure of symbolic representations to solve convex linear and quadratic optimization problems. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.},

QP exhibits symmetry, then the lifted one will generally be

In this article near real-time non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is described for the analysis of a number of data sets acquired from samples of a bi-modal α+β Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn alloy. NMF was used for the first time to reveal absorption artefacts in the elemental distribution images of the samples, where two phases of the alloy, namely α and β, were in superposition. The findings and interpretation of the NMF results were confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation of the layered alloy system. Furthermore, it is shown how the simultaneous factorization of several stacks of elemental distribution images provides uniform basis vectors and consequently simplifies the interpretation of the representation.},

The temporal and spatial development of CLS lesions on the two genotypes were monitored using a hyperspectral microscope. The lesion development on the QTL-carrying, resistant genotype was characterised by a fast and abrupt change in spectral reflectance, whereas it was slower and ultimately more severe on the genotype lacking the QTL.

Many successful approaches alleviate this problem by employing some form of distant supervision, i.e., look into knowledge bases such as Freebase as a source of supervision to create more examples. While this is perfectly reasonable, most distant supervision methods rely on a hand-coded background knowledge that explicitly looks for patterns in text. For example, they assume all sentences containing Person X and Person Y are positive examples of the relation married(X, Y). In this work, we take a different approach -- we infer weakly supervised examples for relations from models learned by using knowledge outside the natural language task. We argue that this method creates more robust examples that are particularly useful when learning the entire information-extraction model (the structure and parameters). We demonstrate on three domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to using distant supervision labels or a smaller set of gold-standard labels.},

Theoretically, combining logic and probability in a unified representation and building general-purpose reasoning tools for it has been the dream of AI, dating back to the late 1980s. Practically, successful statistical relational AI tools enable new applications in several large, complex real-world domains including those involving big data, natural text, social networks, the web, medicine and robotics, among others. Such domains are often characterized by rich relational structure and large amounts of uncertainty. Logic helps to faithfully model the former while probability helps to effectively manage the latter. Our intention here is to give a brief (and necessarily incomplete) overview and invitation to the emerging field of Statistical Relational AI from the perspective of acting optimally and learning to act.},

A relational linear program (RLP) is a declarative LP template defining the objective and the constraints through the logical concepts of objects, relations, and quantified variables. This allows one to express the LP objective and constraints relationally for a varying number of individuals and relations among them without enumerating them. Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logical program consisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP. This ground LP is solved using lifted linear programming. That is, symmetries within the ground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the reduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. In contrast to mainstream LP template languages like AMPL, which features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a more intuitive representation of optimization problems over relational domains. We illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in Markov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision processes, and on collective inference using LP support vector machines.},

This has two benefits. First, off-the-shelf propagation schemes can be used to naturally construct kernels for many graph types, including labeled, partially labeled, unlabeled, directed, and attributed graphs. Second, by leveraging existing efficient and informative propagation schemes, propagation kernels can be considerably faster than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing predictive performance. We will also show that if the graphs at hand have a regular structure, for instance when modeling image or video data, one can exploit this regularity to scale the kernel computation to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes.

Further, a mapping is learned from part-related visual features to good grasping points. The probabilistic logic module makes use of object-task affordances and object/task ontologies to encode rules that generalize over similar object parts and object/task categories. The use of probabilistic logic for task-dependent grasping contrasts with current approaches that usually learn direct mappings from visual perceptions to task-dependent grasping points.

PCA, however, does not yield physically meaningful representations as they often contain negative values. This limitation can be overcome, by employing factor analysis that is restricted to non-negativity. In this paper we present the first application of the Python Matrix Factorization Module (pymf) on XRF data. This is done in a case study on the painting Saul and David from the studio of Rembrandt van Rijn.

In this paper, we improve upon efficiency in two ways. First, we introduce the Cluster Signature Graph (CSG), a platform on which greater portions of the symmetries can be revealed and exploited. CSGs classify clusters of variables by projecting relations between cluster members onto a graph, allowing for the efficient pruning of symmetrical clusters even before their generation. Second, we introduce a novel framework based on CSGs for the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear program (LP) relaxations, dedicated to exploiting this symmetry for the benefit of tight Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approximations. Combined with the pruning power of CSG, the framework quickly generates compact formulations for otherwise intractable LPs, as demonstrated by several empirical results.},

Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed GPC method using privileged noise, called GPC+, improves over a standard GPC without privileged knowledge, and also over the current state-of-the-art SVM-based method, SVM+.

One of the key challenges is modeling and predicting player churn. This paper presents the first cross-game study of churn prediction in Free-to-Play games. Churn in games is discussed and thoroughly defined as a formal problem, aligning with industry standards. Furthermore, a range of features which are generic to games are defined and evaluated for their usefulness in predicting player churn, e.g. playtime, session length and session intervals. Using these behavioral features, combined with the individual retention model for each game in the dataset used, we develop a broadly applicable churn prediction model, which does not rely on gamedesign specific features. The presented classifiers are applied on a dataset covering five free-to-play games resulting in high accuracy churn prediction.},

The common approach for dealing with this problem is the use of sub-sampling of negative examples. We, on the other hand, consider a soft margin approach that explicitly trades off between the false positives and false negatives. We apply this approach to the recently successful formalism of relational functional gradient boosting. Specifically, we modify the objective function of the learning problem to explicitly include the trade-off between false positives and negatives.

We give a sufficient condition for R-convolution kernels that enables kernel computation by explicit mapping. We theoretically and experimentally analyze efficiency and flexibility of implicit kernel functions and dot products of explicitly computed feature maps for widely used graph kernels such as random walk kernels, sub graph matching kernels, and shortest-path kernels. For walk kernels we observe a phase transition when comparing runtime with respect to label diversity and walk lengths leading to the conclusion that explicit computations are only favourable for smaller label sets and walk lengths whereas implicit computation is superior for longer walk lengths and data sets with larger label diversity.},

In this paper, we improve upon efficiency in two ways. First, we introduce the Cluster Signature Graph (CSG), a platform on which greater portions of the symmetries can be revealed and exploited. CSGs classify clusters of variables by projecting relations between cluster members onto a graph, allowing for the efficient pruning of symmetrical clusters even before their generation. Second, we introduce a novel framework based on CSGs for the Sherali-Adams hierarchy of linear program (LP) relaxations, dedicated to exploiting this symmetry for the benefit of tight Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) approximations. Combined with the pruning power of CSG, the framework quickly generates compact formulations for otherwise intractable LPs, as demonstrated by several empirical results.},

Our pipeline consists of three stages---(1) a segmentation layer where brain MRI data is divided into clinically relevant regions; (2) a classification layer that uses relational learning algorithms to make pairwise predictions between the three classes; and (3) a combination layer that combines the results of the different classes to obtain the final classification. One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers.

But perhaps more important is that we are able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the migration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not memoryless but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to make k>1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that migration at later career stages is memoryless. This aligns well but actually goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education and research worldwide.},

Inspired by the success of random walk based schemes for the construction of graph kernels, cwk is defined in terms of the probability that the labels encountered during parallel random walks coincide. In addition to its intuitive probabilistic interpretation, coinciding walk kernels outperform existing kernel- and walk-based methods on the task of node-label prediction in sparsely labeled graphs with high label-structure similarity. We also show that computing cwks is faster than many state-of-the-art kernels on graphs.

However, when dealing with sparsely labeled networks, common in present-day tasks, the autocorrelation assumption is difficult to exploit. Taking a step beyond, we propose the coinciding walk kernel (cwk), a novel kernel leveraging label-structure similarity -- the idea that nodes with similarly arranged labels in their local neighbourhoods are likely to have the same label -- for learning problems on partially labeled graphs. Inspired by the success of random walk based schemes for the construction of graph kernels, cwk is defined in terms of the probability that the labels encountered during parallel random walks coincide. In addition to its intuitive probabilistic interpretation, coinciding walk kernels outperform existing kernel- and walk-based methods on the task of node-label prediction in sparsely labeled graphs with high label-structure similarity. We also show that computing cwks is faster than many state-of-the-art kernels on graphs. We evaluate cwks on several realworld networks, including cocitation and coauthor graphs, as well as a graph of interlinked populated places extracted from the dbpedia knowledge base.},

Typical ways to address this scaling issue are inference by approximate message passing, stochastic gradients, and MapReduce, among others. Often, we encounter inference and training problems with symmetries and redundancies in the graph structure. It has been shown that inference and training can indeed benefit from exploiting symmetries, for example by lifting loopy belief propagation (LBP).That is, a model is compressed by grouping nodes together that send and receive identical messages so that a modified LBP running on the lifted graph yields the same marginals as LBP on the original one, but often in a fraction of time.

In this work, we take a different approach -- we create weakly supervised examples for relations by using commonsense knowledge. The key innovation is that this commonsense knowledge is completely independent of the natural language text. This helps when learning the full model for information extraction as against simply learning the parameters of a known CRF or MLN. We demonstrate on two domains that this form of weak supervision yields superior results when learning structure compared to simply using the gold standard labels.},

Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents. Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

Pre-symptomatic water stress detection is of particular interest, ultimately helping to meet the challenge of ``How to feed a hungry world?''. Due to the climate change, this is of considerable political and public interest. Due to its large-scale and temporal nature, e.g., when monitoring plants using hyper-spectral imaging, and the demand of physical meaning of the results, it presents unique computational problems in scale and interpretability. However, big data matrices over time also arise in several other real-life applications such as stock market monitoring where a business sector is characterized by the ups and downs of each of its companies per year or topic monitoring of document collections. Therefore, we consider the general problem of embedding data matrices into Euclidean space over time without making any assumption on the generating distribution of each matrix. To do so, we represent all data samples by means of convex combinations of only few extreme ones computable in linear time. On the simplex spanned by the extremes, there are then natural candidates for distributions inducing distances between and in turn embeddings of the data matrices. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic, text, and financial data as well as a large-scale dataset on water stress detection in plants with more than 3 billion matrix entries. The results demonstrate that the embeddings are meaningful and fast to compute. The stress detection results were validated by a domain expert and conform to existing plant physiological knowledge.

  	Note = {Low-rank approximations which are computed from selected rows and columns of a given data matrix have attracted considerable attention lately. They have been proposed as an alternative to the SVD because they naturally lead to interpretable decompositions which was shown to be successful in application such as fraud detection, fMRI segmentation, and collaborative filtering. The CUR decomposition of large matrices, for example, samples rows and columns according to a probability distribution that depends on the Euclidean norm of rows or columns or on other measures of statistical leverage. At the same time, there are various deterministic approaches that do not resort to sampling and were found to often yield factorization of superior quality with respect to reconstruction accuracy. However, these are hardly applicable to large matrices as they typically suffer from high computational costs. Consequently, many practitioners in the field of data mining have abandon deterministic approaches in favor of randomized ones when dealing with today's large-scale data sets. In this paper, we empirically disprove this prejudice. We do so by introducing a novel, linear-time, deterministic CUR approach that adopts the recently introduced Simplex Volume Maximization approach for column selection. The latter has already been proven to be successful for NMF-like decompositions of matrices of billions of entries. Our exhaustive empirical study on more than 30 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrates that it is also beneficial for CUR-like decompositions. Compared to other deterministic CUR-like methods, it provides comparable reconstruction quality but operates much faster so that it easily scales to matrices of billions of elements. Compared to sampling-based methods, it provides competitive reconstruction quality while staying in the same run-time complexity class.},

When applied to game telemetry data, pattern recognition and statistical analysis provide valuable business intelligence tools for game development. An important problem in this area is to characterize how player engagement in a game evolves over time. Reliable models are of pivotal interest since they allow for assessing the long-term success of game products and can provide estimates of how long players may be expected to keep actively playing a game. In this paper, we introduce methods from random process theory into game data mining in order to draw inferences about player engagement. Given large samples (over 250,000 players) of behavioral telemetry data from five different action-adventure and shooter games, we extract information as to how long individual players have played these games and apply techniques from lifetime analysis to identify common patterns. In all five cases, we find that the Weibull distribution gives a good account of the statistics of total playing times. This implies that an average player's interest in playing one of the games considered evolves according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Therefore, given data on the initial playtime behavior of the players of a game, it becomes possible to predict when they stop playing.},

A prominent example are probabilistic logical models that tackle a long standing goal of AI, namely unifying first-order logic --- capturing regularities and symmetries --- and probability --- capturing uncertainty. Although they often encode large, complex models using few rules only and, hence, symmetries and redundancies abound, inference in them was originally still at the propositional representation level and did not exploit symmetries.

Our key insight is that while there may be an infinite number of observations, there are only a finite number of continuous observation partitionings that are relevant for optimal decision-making when a finite, fixed set of reachable belief states is considered. To this end, we make two important contributions: (1) we show how previous exact symbolic dynamic programming solutions for continuous state MDPs can be generalized to continuous state POMDPs with discrete observations, and (2) we show how recently developed symbolic integration methods allow this solution to be extended to PBVI for continuous state and observation POMDPs with potentially correlated, multivariate continuous observation spaces.},

One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers.

For proportional data (normalized histograms), this is not the case. Due to the sum-to-unity constraint, features that are as independent as possible will not all be uncorrelated. In this paper, we show that a linear-time transformation efficiently copes with sum-to-unity constraints: first, we select a small number K of diverse data points by maximizing the volume of the simplex spanned by these prototypes; second, we represent each data point by means of its cosine similarities to the K selected prototypes. This maximum volume hashing is sensible since each dimension in the transformed space is likely to follow a von Mises (vM) distribution, and, in very high dimensions, the vM distribution closely resembles a Gaussian distribution. This justifies to employ PCA on the transformed data. Our extensive experiments validate this: maximum volume hashing outperforms spectral hashing and other state of the art techniques.},

Hyper-spectral imaging provides a particularly promising approach to gain such understanding since it allows to discover non-destructively spectral characteristics of plants governed primarily by scattering and absorption characteristics of the leaf internal structure and biochemical constituents. Several drought stress indices have been derived using hyper-spectral imaging. However, they are typically based on few hyper-spectral images only, rely on interpretations of experts, and consider few wavelengths only. In this study, we present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought stress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive scale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we develop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation with convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets and, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological practices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge and can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA approaches.},

It is an unsupervised classification approach, optimised for fast computation of massive datasets. It allows calculation of how similar each spectrum is to observed typical spectra.

The method was tested for drought stress, applied to potted barley plants in a controlled rain-out shelter experiment and to agricultural corn plots subjected to a two factorial field setup altering water and nutrient availability. Both experiments were conducted on the canopy level. SiVM was significantly better than using a combination of established vegetation indices.

We address this problem in the context of model-based reinforcement learning in large stochastic relational domains by developing relational extensions of the concepts of the E3 and R-MAX algorithms. Efficient exploration in exponentially large state spaces needs to exploit the generalization of the learned model: what in a propositional setting would be considered a novel situation and worth exploration may in the relational setting be a well-known context in which exploitation is promising. To address this we introduce relational count functions which generalize the classical notion of state and action visitation counts. We provide guarantees on the exploration efficiency of our framework using count functions under the assumption that we had a relational KWIK learner and a near-optimal planner. We propose a concrete exploration algorithm which integrates a practically efficient probabilistic rule learner and a relational planner (for which there are no guarantees, however) and employs the contexts of learned relational rules as features to model the novelty of states and actions. Our results in noisy 3D simulated robot manipulation problems and in domains of the international planning competition demonstrate that our approach is more effective than existing propositional and factored exploration techniques.},

While it is widely recognized that the scheduling of documents in stochastic optimization and in turn in LDA may have significant consequences, this issue remains largely unexplored. Instead, practitioners schedule documents essentially uniformly at random, due perhaps to ease of implementation, and to the lack of clear guidelines on scheduling the documents. In this work, we address this issue and propose to schedule documents for an update that exert a disproportionately large influence on the topics of the corpus before less influential ones. More precisely, we justify to sample documents randomly biased towards those ones with higher norms to form mini-batches. On several real-world datasets, including 3M articles from Wikipedia and 8M from PubMed, we demonstrate that the resulting influence scheduled LDA can handily analyze massive document collections and find topic models as good or better than those found with online LDA, often at a fraction of time.},

To reduce noise in the gradient estimation, it considers multiple documents chosen uniformly at random. While it is widely recognized that the scheduling of documents in stochastic optimization may have significant consequences, this issue remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this issue. Specifically, we propose residual LDA, a novel, easy-to-implement, LDA approach that schedules documents in an informed way.

Another well-known scientific field that impacts lives of billions is biological sequence analysis. It has experienced an incredible evolution in the recent decade, especially since the Human Genome project. Although, a very first link between both fields has been established already in the early 90ies, many recent papers on mobility mining seem to be unaware of it. We therefore revisit the link and show that many unexplored and novel mobility mining methods fall naturally out of it. Specifically, using advanced discretization techniques for stay-point detection and map matching, we turn traffic sequences into a biological ones. Then, we introduce a novel distance function that enables us to directly apply the rich toolbox for biological sequence analysis to it. For instance, by just looking at co mplex traffic data through the biological glasses of sequence logos we get a novel, easy-to-grasp visualization of data, called Traffic Logos. For clustering and prediction tasks, our empirical evaluation on three real-world data sets demonstrates that revisiting the link can yield performance as good as state-of-the-art data mining techniques.},

Specifically, we compute an initial ranking using personalized PageRank. Then, we find paths of atoms that are connected via their arguments, variablize the ground atoms in each path, in order to create features for the query. These features are used to re-personalize the original RWR and to finally compute the set completion, based on Label Propagation. Moreover, we exploit that RWR techniques can naturally be lifted and show that lifted inference for label propagation is possible. We evaluate our algorithm on a realworld relational dataset by finding completions of sets of objects describing the Roman city of Pompeii.

A popular solution in these cases is the idea of turning the complex inference task into a sequence of simpler ones by selecting and clamping variables one at a time and running lifted message passing again after each selection. This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference. We show how to avoid this by efficiently computing the lifted network for each conditioning directly from the one already known for the single node marginals. Our experiments show that significant efficiency gains are possible for lifted message passing guided decimation for SAT and sampling.},

For propositional worlds, functional gradient methods have been proved to be beneficial. They are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient, more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the form of the function. Building on recent generalizations of functional gradient boosting to relational representations, we implement a functional gradient boosting approach to imitation learning in relational domains. In particular, given a set of traces from the human teacher, our system learns a policy in the form of a set of relational regression trees that additively approximate the functional gradients. The use of multiple additive trees combined with relational representation allows for learning more expressive policies than what has been done before. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in several different domains.},

Current methods for learning MLNs follow a twostep approach: first, perform a search through the space of possible clauses and then learn appropriate weights for these clauses. We propose to take a different approach, namely to learn both the weights and the structure of the MLN simultaneously. Our approach is based on functional gradient boosting where the problem of learning MLNs is turned into a series of relational functional approximation problems. We use two kinds of representations for the gradients: clausebased and tree-based. Our experimental evaluation on several benchmark data sets demonstrates that our new approach can learn MLNs as good or better than those found with state-ofthe-art methods, but often in a fraction of the time.},

Consequently, symmetries across the inference tasks are not exploited. In this paper, we present a novel lifted message passing technique that exploits symmetries across multiple evidence cases.

  	Note = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

In this paper, we introduce several new ideas enhancing the applicability of FODDs. More specifically, we first introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and composition operations for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we develop a novel approach for reducing (G)FODDs using model checking. This yields -- for the first time -- a reduction that maximally reduces the diagram for the FODD case and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs. Finally we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a complete solution for the case where the reward function is specified using an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers.},

Among the advantages of this approach are the ability to maintain compact value function representations, abstract over the space of potentially optimal actions, and automatically derive compact conditional policy trees that minimally partition relational observation spaces according to distinctions that have an impact on policy values. This is the first lifted relational POMDP solution that can optimally accommodate actions with a potentially infinite relational space of observation outcomes.},

We demonstrate this idea by introducing novel model-checking reduction operations for First Order Decision Diagrams (FODD), a representation that has been used to implement decision-theoretic planning with Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDP). Intuitively, these reductions modify the construction of the value function by removing any complex specifications that are irrelevant to the set of training examples, thereby focusing on the region of interest. We show that such training examples can be constructed on the fly from a description of the planning problem thus we can bootstrap to get a self-taught planning system. Additionally, we provide a new heuristic to embed universal and conjunctive goals within the framework of RMDP planners, expanding the scope and applicability of such systems. We show that these ideas lead to significant improvements in performance in terms of both speed and coverage of the planner, yielding state of the art planning performance on problems from the International Planning Competition.},

While this certainly has its advantages, arguably, a more flexible and intuitive way would be to sort images into arbitrary structures such as grids, hierarchies, or spheres so that images that are visually or semantically alike are placed together. This paper focuses on designing such a navigation system for image browsers. This is a challenging task because arbitrary layout structure makes it difficult -- if not impossible -- to compute cross-similarities between images and structure coordinates, the main ingredient of traditional layouting approaches. For this reason, we resort to a recently developed machine learning technique: kernelized sorting. It is a general technique for matching pairs of objects from different domains without requiring cross-domain similarity measures and hence elegantly allows sorting images into arbitrary structures.

This is an important learning problem for applications where absolute feedback is difficult to elicit, but pairwise judgments are readily available (e.g., via implicit feedback [13]). While it was already shown that active learning can effectively reduce the number of training pairs needed, the most successful existing algorithms cannot generalize over items or queries. Considering web search as an example, they would need to learn a separate relevance score for each document-query pair from scratch. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose a link-based active preference learning method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) that incorporates dependency information from both feature-vector representations as well as relations. Specifically, to meet the requirement on computational efficiency of active exploration, we introduce a novel incremental update method that scales as well as the non-generalizing models. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on datasets for information retrieval, showing that it learns substantially faster than algorithms that cannot model dependencies.},

Essentially, we select variables one at a time for conditioning, running lifted belief propagation after each selection. This naive solution, however, recomputes the lifted network in each step from scratch, therefore often canceling the benefits of lifted inference. We show how to avoid this by efficiently computing the lifted network for each conditioning directly from the one already known for the single node marginals. Our experimental results validate that significant efficiency gains are possible and illustrate the potential for second-order parameter estimation of Markov logic networks.},

In this paper, we advocate to view this task as a problem of fast, large-scale retrieval. Intuitively, given a dataset of millions of labeled scan points and their neighborhoods, we simply search for similar points in the datasets and use the labels of the retrieved ones to predict the labels of a novel point using some local prediction model such as majority vote or logistic regression. However, actually carrying this out requires highly efficient ways of (1) storing millions of scan points in memory and (2) quickly finding similar scan points to a target scan point. In this paper, we propose to address both issues by employing Weiss et al.'s recent spectral hashing. It represents each item in a database by a compact binary code that is constructed so that similar items will have similar binary code words. In turn, similar neighbors have codes within a small Hamming distance of the code for the query. Then, we learn a logistic regression model locally over all points with the same binary code word. Our experiments on real world 3D scans show that the resulting approach, called spectrally hashed logistic regression, can be ultra fast at prediction time and outperforms state-of-the art approaches such as logistic regression and nearest neighbor.},

There is, however, no free lunch: imposing convexity constraints on W typically prevents adaptation to intrinsic, low dimensional structures in the data. Alas, in cases where the data is distributed in a non-convex manner or consists of mixtures of lower dimensional convex distributions, the cluster representatives obtained from CH-NMF will be less meaningful. In this paper, we present a hierarchical CH-NMF that automatically adapts to internal structures of a dataset, hence it yields meaningful and interpretable clusters for non-convex datasets.

Surprisingly, kernel methods have not received attention yet although they are very popular in the machine learning community due to their solid mathematical foundation, tendency toward easy geometric interpretation, and strong empirical performance in a wide variety of domains. In this paper, we show how to employ kernels for map matching. Specifically, ignoring map constraints, we first maximize the consistency between the similarity measures captured by the kernel matrices of the trajectory and relevant part of the street map. The resulting relaxed assignment is then ''rounded'' into a hard assignment fulfilling the map constraints.

Recently, lifted belief propagation (LBP) has been proposed as an efficient approximate solution of this inference problem. It runs a modified BP on a lifted network where nodes have been grouped together if they have --- roughly speaking --- identical computation trees, the tree-structured unrolling of the underlying graph rooted at the nodes. In many situations, this purely syntactic criterion is too pessimistic: message errors decay along paths. Intuitively, for a long chain graph with weak edge potentials, distant nodes will send and receive identical messages yet their computation trees are quite different. To overcome this, we propose iLBP, a novel, easy-to-implement, informed LBP approach that interleaves lifting and modified BP iterations. In turn, we can efficiently monitor the true BP messages sent and received in each iteration and group nodes accordingly. As our experiments show, iLBP can yield significantly faster more lifted network while not degrading performance. Above all, we show that iLBP is faster than BP when solving the problem of distributing data to a large network, an important real-world application where BP is faster than uninformed LBP.},

Nevertheless, it can induce severe mechanical stress to the lung, which generally impairs the outcome of the therapy. To reduce the risk of a ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), lung protective ventilation is essential, especially for patients with a previous medical history like the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The prerequisite for lung protective ventilation approaches is the knowledge about the physical behavior of the human lung under the condition of mechanical ventilation. This knowledge is commonly described by mathematical models. Diverse models have been introduced to represent particular aspects of mechanical characteristics of the lung. A commonly accepted general model is the equation of motion, which relates the airway pressure to the airflow and the volume applied by the ventilator and describes the influence of the distensibility and resistance of the respiratory system. Equation Discovery systems extract mathematical models from observed time series data. To reduce the vast search space associated with this task, the LAGRAMGE-system introduced the application of declarative bias in Equation Discovery, which furthermore allows the presentation of domain specific knowledge. We introduce a modification of this system and apply it to data obtained during mechanical ventilation of ARDS-patients. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach and show that the equation of motion model can automatically be rediscovered from real-world data.},

We consider a constrained matrix factorization s.t.~the latent components form a simplex that encloses most of the remaining data. The algorithm maximizes the volume of that simplex and thereby reduces the displacement of data from the space spanned by the latent components. Hence, it also lowers the Frobenius norm, a common criterion for matrix factorization quality. Our algorithm is efficient, well-grounded in distance geometry, and easily applicable to matrices with billions of entries. In addition, the resulting factors allow for an intuitive interpretation of data: every data point can now be expressed as a convex combination of the most extreme and thereby often most descriptive instances in a collection of data. Extensive experimental validations on web-scale data, including 80 million images and 1.5 million twitter tweets, demonstrate superior performance compared to related factorization or clustering techniques.},

The hidden variables, one for each object, are able to transport information such that non-local probabilistic dependencies can be obtained. The model can be used to predict entity attributes, to predict relationships between entities and it performs an interpretable cluster analysis. We demonstrate the performance of IHRMs with three social network applications.

  	Note = {First order decision diagrams (FODD) were recently introduced as a compact knowledge representation expressing functions over relational structures. FODDs represent numerical functions that, when constrained to the Boolean range, use only existential quantification. Previous work developed a set of operations over FODDs, showed how they can be used to solve relational Markov decision processes (RMDP) using dynamic programming algorithms, and demonstrated their success in solving stochastic planning problems from the International Planning Competition in the system FODD-Planner. A crucial ingredient of this scheme is a set of operations to remove redundancy in decision diagrams, thus keeping them compact. This paper makes three contributions. First, we introduce Generalized FODDs (GFODD) and combination algorithms for them, generalizing FODDs to arbitrary quantification. Second, we show how GFODDs can be used in principle to solve RMDPs with arbitrary quantification, and develop a particularly promising case where an arbitrary number of existential quantifiers is followed by an arbitrary number of universal quantifiers. Third, we develop a new approach to reduce FODDs and GFODDs using model checking. This yields a reduction that is complete for FODDs and provides a sound reduction procedure for GFODDs.},

  	Note = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a standard tool in data mining, information retrieval, and signal processing. It is used to factorize a non-negative data matrix into two non-negative matrix factors that contain basis elements and linear coefficients, respectively. Often, the columns of the first resulting factor are interpreted as ``cluster centroids'' of the input data, and the columns of the second factor are understood to contain cluster membership indicators. When analyzing data such as collections of gene expressions, documents, or images, it is often beneficial to ensure that the resulting cluster centroids are meaningful, for instance, by restricting them to be convex combinations of data points. However, known approaches to convex-NMF suffer from high computational costs and therefore hardly apply to large-scale data analysis problems. This paper presents a new framework for convex-NMF that allows for an efficient factorization of data matrices of millions of data points. Triggered by the simple observation that each data point can be expressed as a convex combination of vertices of the data convex hull, we require the basic factors to be vertices of the data convex hull. The benefits of convex-hull NMF are twofold. First, for a growing number of data points the expected size of the convex hull, i.e. the number of its vertices, grows much slower than the dataset. Second, distance preserving low-dimensional embeddings allow us to efficiently sample the convex hull and hence to quickly determine candidate vertices. Our extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets shows that convex-hull NMF compares favorably to convex-NMF in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that our method can easily be applied to large-scale, real-world datasets, in our case consisting of 750,000 DBLP entries, 4,000,000 digital images, and 150,000,000 votes on World of Warcraft {\textregistered}guilds, respectively.},

In this paper, we describe a non-parametric policy gradient approach -- called NPPG -- that overcomes this limitation. The key idea is to apply Friedmann's gradient boosting: policies are represented as a weighted sum of regression models grown in an stage-wise optimization.

This comes at the expense of a more complex reward model selection problem: virtually infinitely many abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we apply gradientbased boosting to leverage this problem. Specifically, we show how to reduce the learning problem to a series of relational regressions problems.

In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic measurement model for range finders, called Gaussian beam processes, which treats the measurement modeling task as a nonparametric Bayesian regression problem and solves it using Gaussian processes. The major benefit of our approach is its ability to generalize over entire range scans directly. This way, we can learn the distributions of range measurements for whole regions of the robot's configuration space from only few recorded or simulated range scans. Especially in approximative approaches to state estimation like particle filtering or histogram filtering, this leads to a better approximation of the true likelihood function. Experiments on real world and synthetic data show that Gaussian beam processes combine the advantages of two popular measurement models.},

Our aim was to show that inductive machine learning can be used to gain insights into differences and similarities among these methods. We defined two tasks: the first one was to recognize the measurement method producing a given pressure--volume curve. This was defined as the task of classifying pressure--volume curves (the classes being the measurement methods). The second was to model the curves themselves, that is, to predict the volume given the pressure, the measurement method and the patient data. Clearly, this can be defined as a regression task. For these two tasks, we applied C5.0 and CUBIST, two inductive machine learning tools, respectively. Apart from medical findings regarding the characteristics of the measurement methods, we found some evidence showing the value of an abstract representation for classifying curves: normalization and high-level descriptors from curve fitting played a crucial role in obtaining reasonably accurate models. Another useful feature of algorithms for inductive machine learning is the possibility of incorporating background knowledge. In our study, the incorporation of patient data helped to improve regression results dramatically, which might open the door for the individual respiratory treatment of patients in the future.},
